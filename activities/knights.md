Puzzles- Knights and Knaves
===========================

The following puzzles are all from books by the famous logician Raymond Smullyan. He has written a number of "recreational math/logic" books that teach the basics of higher-level logic using puzzles such as these.

On a fictional island, all inhabitants are either knights, who always tell the truth, or knaves, who always lie.

Ada and Charles are residents of the island of knights and knaves.

**Question 1**

Ada says: We are both knaves

Who is what?

**Question 2**

Ada: If (and only if) Charles is a knave, then I am a knave.

Charles: We are of different kinds.

Who is who?

**Question 3**

Ada and Charles are standing at a fork in the road. You know that one of them is a knight and the other a knave, but you don't know which. You also know that one road leads to Death, and the other leads to Freedom. By asking one yes/no question, can you determine the road to Freedom?
