        "**Variables and Data Types:**\n",
        "- `int` - whole numbers (customer ages, drink quantities)\n",
        "- `double` - decimal numbers (prices, tab totals)\n",
        "- `String` - text (customer names, drink orders)\n",
        "- `boolean` - true/false values (is the tavern open?)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Basic Operations:**\n",
        "- Arithmetic with `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`\n",
        "- Storing and using information in variables\n",
        "- Displaying output with `System.out.println()`\n",

        "\n",
        "**By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:**\n",
        "- Make your programs choose different actions based on conditions\n",
        "- Check customer ages and IDs automatically\n",
        "- Store and manage multiple drink orders at once\n",
        "- Repeat tasks efficiently (like checking all customers)\n",
        "- Build a complete tavern management system\n",

        "- **Check IDs** - Only serve customers who are 21 or older\n",
        "- **Calculate prices** - Different rates for happy hour vs regular time\n",
        "- **Manage inventory** - Keep track of multiple beers on tap\n",
        "- **Handle rush periods** - Process many customer orders efficiently\n",

        "### Real-World Decisions at Moe's Tavern\n",
        "\n",
        "Every day, Moe makes countless decisions to run his tavern effectively:\n",

        "**Customer Service Decisions:**\n",
        "- Is this customer old enough to drink? (21+ required!)\n",

        "- Do we have enough inventory for the weekend rush?\n",

        "- Is the tavern at maximum capacity?\n",
        "- Is it time for last call?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Programs Need to Make Decisions Too\n",
        "\n",
        "Just like Moe can't treat every customer and situation exactly the same, our programs need to be smart enough to respond differently based on the circumstances.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Without Decision-Making (Dumb Program):**\n",
        "```java\n",
        "System.out.println(\"Welcome to Moe's!\");\n",
        "System.out.println(\"That'll be $5.00 for your beer.\");\n",

        "```\n",
        "*Now our program can make appropriate decisions!*\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Power of Conditional Programming\n",
        "\n",
        "Conditionals (if statements) are like giving your program a brain. They allow your code to:\n",
        "- **Respond appropriately** to different situations\n",
        "- **Enforce rules** automatically (like age limits)\n",
        "- **Provide personalized experiences** for different users\n",
        "- **Handle errors gracefully** instead of crashing\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### The if Statement Structure\n",
        "\n",
        "An `if` statement is like asking a yes/no question. If the answer is \"yes\" (true), the code inside the braces runs. If the answer is \"no\" (false), the code is skipped.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Basic Syntax:**\n",
        "```java\n",
        "if (condition) {\n",
        "    // Code that runs if condition is true\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Breaking Down the Parts\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. The Keyword:** `if` tells Java we're making a decision\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. The Condition:** Goes inside parentheses `(condition)`\n",
        "   - Must be something that's either true or false\n",
        "   - Usually involves a boolean variable or comparison\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. The Braces:** `{ }` contain the code that runs if the condition is true\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. The Code:** Instructions that execute only when the condition is met\n",
        "\n",
        "### Simple Moe's Tavern Example\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's say we want to greet regular customers differently:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "boolean isRegular = true;\n",
        "if (isRegular) {\n",
        "    System.out.println(\"Hey there, usual customer! The usual?\");\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**What happens here:**\n",
        "- We have a boolean variable `isRegular` set to `true`\n",
        "- The `if` statement checks: \"Is `isRegular` true?\"\n",
        "- Since it is true, the greeting gets printed\n",
        "- If `isRegular` were `false`, nothing would print\n",
        "\n",
        "### Another Example - Checking Customer Age\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "int customerAge = 25;\n",
        "boolean canDrink = customerAge >= 21;\n",
        "\n",
        "if (canDrink) {\n",
        "    System.out.println(\"Welcome to Moe's! What can I get you?\");\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step by step:**\n",
        "1. Customer's age is 25\n",
        "2. We check if 25 >= 21 (true)\n",
        "3. `canDrink` becomes `true`\n",
        "4. The welcome message prints\n",
        "\n",
        "### Important Rules for if Statements\n",
        "\n",
        "**The condition must be boolean:**\n",
        "- ‚úÖ `if (isRegular)` - boolean variable\n",
        "- ‚úÖ `if (age >= 21)` - comparison that results in true/false\n",
        "- ‚ùå `if (customerName)` - String is not true/false\n",
        "- ‚ùå `if (25)` - numbers are not true/false\n",
        "\n",
        "**Always use parentheses and braces:**\n",
        "- ‚úÖ `if (condition) { code; }`\n",
        "- ‚ùå `if condition { code; }` - missing parentheses\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of an `if` statement like Moe checking someone's ID - if they pass the test, they get served; if not, the code (serving drinks) doesn't happen!"
