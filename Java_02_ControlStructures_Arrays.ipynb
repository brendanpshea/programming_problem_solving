        "Great job completing your first Java programming lesson! Let's quickly review what you've mastered:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Variables and Data Types:**\n",
        "- `int` - whole numbers (customer ages, drink quantities)\n",
        "- `double` - decimal numbers (prices, tab totals)\n",
        "- `String` - text (customer names, drink orders)\n",
        "- `boolean` - true/false values (is the tavern open?)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Basic Operations:**\n",
        "- Arithmetic with `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`\n",

        "Welcome to **Moe's Tavern** - Springfield's finest (and only) neighborhood bar! Today we're going to make our programs much smarter by learning how to make decisions and handle multiple pieces of information.\n",
        "\n",
        "**By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:**\n",
        "- Make your programs choose different actions based on conditions\n",

        "- **Manage inventory** - Keep track of multiple beers on tap\n",
        "- **Handle rush periods** - Process many customer orders efficiently\n",

        "\n",
        "Every day, Moe makes countless decisions to run his tavern effectively:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Customer Service Decisions:**\n",
        "- Is this customer old enough to drink? (21+ required!)\n",

        "**Business Decisions:**\n",
        "- Is it happy hour? (50% off drinks 5-7 PM)\n",
        "- Should we stay open late tonight?\n",
        "- Do we have enough inventory for the weekend rush?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Safety and Legal Decisions:**\n",
        "- Does this customer have proper ID?\n",
        "- Is the tavern at maximum capacity?\n",
        "- Is it time for last call?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Programs Need to Make Decisions Too\n",
        "\n",
        "Just like Moe can't treat every customer and situation exactly the same, our programs need to be smart enough to respond differently based on the circumstances.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Without Decision-Making (Dumb Program):**\n",
        "```java\n",
        "System.out.println(\"Welcome to Moe's!\");\n",
        "System.out.println(\"That'll be $5.00 for your beer.\");\n",

        "*Now our program can make appropriate decisions!*\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Power of Conditional Programming\n",
        "\n",
        "Conditionals (if statements) are like giving your program a brain. They allow your code to:\n",
        "- **Respond appropriately** to different situations\n",
        "- **Enforce rules** automatically (like age limits)\n",
        "- **Provide personalized experiences** for different users\n",

        "\n",
        "### The if Statement Structure\n",
        "\n",
        "An `if` statement is like asking a yes/no question. If the answer is \"yes\" (true), the code inside the braces runs. If the answer is \"no\" (false), the code is skipped.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Basic Syntax:**\n",
        "```java\n",
        "if (condition) {\n",
        "    // Code that runs if condition is true\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Breaking Down the Parts\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. The Keyword:** `if` tells Java we're making a decision\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. The Condition:** Goes inside parentheses `(condition)`\n",
        "   - Must be something that's either true or false\n",
        "   - Usually involves a boolean variable or comparison\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. The Braces:** `{ }` contain the code that runs if the condition is true\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. The Code:** Instructions that execute only when the condition is met\n",
        "\n",
        "### Simple Moe's Tavern Example\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's say we want to greet regular customers differently:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "boolean isRegular = true;\n",
        "if (isRegular) {\n",
        "    System.out.println(\"Hey there, usual customer! The usual?\");\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**What happens here:**\n",
        "- We have a boolean variable `isRegular` set to `true`\n",
        "- The `if` statement checks: \"Is `isRegular` true?\"\n",
        "- Since it is true, the greeting gets printed\n",
        "- If `isRegular` were `false`, nothing would print\n",
        "\n",
        "### Another Example - Checking Customer Age\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "int customerAge = 25;\n",
        "boolean canDrink = customerAge >= 21;\n",
        "\n",
        "if (canDrink) {\n",
        "    System.out.println(\"Welcome to Moe's! What can I get you?\");\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step by step:**\n",
        "1. Customer's age is 25\n",
        "2. We check if 25 >= 21 (true)\n",
        "3. `canDrink` becomes `true`\n",
        "4. The welcome message prints\n",
        "\n",
        "### Important Rules for if Statements\n",
        "\n",
        "**The condition must be boolean:**\n",
        "- ‚úÖ `if (isRegular)` - boolean variable\n",
        "- ‚úÖ `if (age >= 21)` - comparison that results in true/false\n",
        "- ‚ùå `if (customerName)` - String is not true/false\n",
        "- ‚ùå `if (25)` - numbers are not true/false\n",
        "\n",
        "**Always use parentheses and braces:**\n",
        "- ‚úÖ `if (condition) { code; }`\n",
        "- ‚ùå `if condition { code; }` - missing parentheses\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**Loops** let you repeat code multiple times without writing it over and over. They're like giving Moe instructions: \"Do this greeting for every customer who walks in.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### When Moe's Tavern Uses Repetition\n",
        "\n",
        "**Daily Operations:**\n",
        "- Check the ID of every customer entering\n",
        "- Take orders from each person at the bar\n",
        "- Clean each glass after closing\n",
        "- Count money in the register\n",
        "\n",
        "**Business Management:**\n",
        "- Print receipts for all daily transactions\n",
        "- Check inventory levels for all drinks\n",
        "- Send loyalty point updates to all members\n",
        "- Calculate tips for all servers\n",
        "\n",
        "### Types of Loops in Java\n",
        "\n",
        "**for loops:** When you know how many times to repeat\n",
        "- \"Serve 5 customers\"\n",
        "- \"Check all 10 beer taps\"  \n",
        "- \"Process every item in the menu\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**while loops:** When you repeat until a condition changes\n",
        "- \"Keep serving until closing time\"\n",
        "- \"Take orders while customers are waiting\"\n",
        "- \"Keep the music playing while people are dancing\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Loop Benefits\n",
        "\n",
        "**Less Code:** Write once, repeat many times\n",
        "**Fewer Errors:** No copy-paste mistakes\n",
        "**Flexibility:** Easy to change how many times something repeats\n",
        "**Scalability:** Works with any amount of data\n",

        "|------|------------|\n",
        "| **AND Operator** | The logical operator (&&) that returns true only when both conditions are true. For example, `hasID && age >= 21` evaluates to true only if both conditions are met. |\n",
        "| **Array** | A data structure that stores multiple values of the same type in a single container. For example, `drinkNames = {\"Beer\", \"Wine\", \"Soda\"}` holds three string values. |\n",
        "| **Array Declaration** | The process of creating an array variable and specifying its type and initial values. For example, `String[] names = {\"Bart\", \"Lisa\"};` creates an array with two elements. |\n",
        "| **Array Index** | The position number used to access elements in an array, starting from 0. For example, `names[0]` accesses the first element, `names[1]` accesses the second. |\n",
        "| **`arrayName.length`** | A property that returns the number of elements in an array. For example, if `drinks._____` equals 5, the array contains five elements. |\n",
        "| **Comparison Operators** | Symbols used to compare values and create boolean expressions. For example, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, and `!=`. |\n",
        "| **Compound Conditional** | A logical expression that combines multiple conditions using AND or OR operators. For example, `age >= 21 && hasID` checks both age and ID status. |\n",
        "| **Condition** | A boolean expression that evaluates to either true or false in control structures. For example, `customerAge >= 21` creates a condition for age verification. |\n",
        "| **Conditional Statement** | A programming structure that executes different code based on whether conditions are true or false. For example, if-else statements that branch program flow. |\n",
        "| **Control Structure** | Programming constructs that determine the order in which code executes. For example, if statements, loops, and switch statements that control program flow. |\n",
        "| **Decrement** | The operation of decreasing a variable's value, typically by 1. For example, `i--` reduces the value of i by one. |\n",
        "| **`else`** | A keyword that specifies code to execute when an if condition is false. For example, the alternative path when age verification fails. |\n",
        "| **`else if`** | A keyword combination that allows testing multiple conditions in sequence. For example, checking different time periods for pricing tiers. |\n",
        "| **Equality Operator** | The double equals sign (==) used to test if two values are the same. For example, `drinkSize == 'L'` checks if the size equals large. |\n",
        "| **`for`** | A loop structure that repeats code a specific number of times with automatic counting. For example, `____(int i = 0; i < 5; i++)` runs five iterations. |\n",
        "| **`if`** | A conditional statement that executes code only when a specified condition is true. For example, `____(condition){\\\\ do something}`. |\n",
        "| **Increment** | The operation of increasing a variable's value, typically by 1. For example, `i++` adds one to the current value of i. |\n",
        "| **Index Out of Bounds** | An error that occurs when trying to access an array element at a position that doesn't exist. For example, accessing `array[5]` when the array only has 4 elements. |\n",
        "| **Infinite Loop** | A loop that continues forever because its termination condition never becomes false. For example, forgetting to increment a counter variable in a while loop. |\n",
        "| **Loop** | A programming structure that repeats code multiple times until a condition is met. For example, processing every customer in a list automatically. |\n",
        "| **Loop Body** | The code inside a loop that gets executed during each iteration. For example, the statements between the braces in a for loop. |\n",
        "| **Logical Operators** | Symbols that combine or modify boolean values to create complex conditions. For example, && (AND), || (OR), and ! (NOT). |\n",
        "| **Nested Conditional** | An if statement placed inside another if statement to create more complex decision logic. For example, checking customer type after verifying age requirements. |\n",
        "| **OR Operator** | The logical operator (||) that returns true when at least one condition is true. For example, `isWeekend || isHoliday` for extended hours. |\n",
        "| **Parallel Arrays** | Multiple arrays where elements at the same index position relate to each other. For example, `names[0]` and `prices[0]` both refer to the same menu item. |\n",
        "| **Termination Condition** | The boolean expression in a loop that determines when the loop should stop. For example, `i < array.length` ensures the loop doesn't exceed array bounds. |\n",
        "| **while Loop** | A loop structure `______ (condition){\\\\ do something}` that continues executing while a condition remains true. For example, serving customers while the tavern is open and under capacity. |"
