        "### Brendan Shea, PhD\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to the world of **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP)! If you've ever played Dungeons & Dragons or any role-playing game, you already understand the core concepts of OOP without realizing it. Just as D&D organizes complex adventures using character sheets, spell lists, and monster stat blocks, OOP organizes complex programs using classes and objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Until now, you've been writing **procedural programming** - code that follows a step-by-step recipe from top to bottom. This approach works great for simple programs, but imagine trying to manage an entire D&D campaign with just a single, massive list of instructions. You'd have character stats mixed with spell descriptions, combat rules scattered throughout, and no clear way to organize the chaos.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is Object-Oriented Programming?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Object-Oriented Programming** is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects that represent real-world entities. Instead of writing one long sequence of instructions, you create templates (called **classes**) that define what things are and what they can do, then create specific instances (called **objects**) based on those templates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think about how D&D works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Character Classes** define what types of heroes exist (Fighter, Wizard, Rogue)\n",
        "2. **Character Sheets** are filled-out templates for specific heroes (Aragorn the Ranger, Gandalf the Wizard)\n",
        "3. **Game Rules** define what actions characters can perform (attack, cast spells, heal)\n",

        "void levelUpHero(int currentLevel) { }\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Object-Oriented Approach (what we're learning now):**\n",

        "\n",
        "The most fundamental concept in object-oriented programming is understanding the difference between **classes** and **objects**. This distinction is like the difference between a blank character sheet template and the actual filled-out character sheets for your D&D heroes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Classes: The Blueprint\n",
        "\n",
        "A **class** is a template or blueprint that defines what something should look like and what it can do. In D&D terms, think of a class as the blank character sheet template that Wizards of the Coast prints - it has spaces for name, stats, equipment, and spells, but no specific information filled in.\n",
        "\n",
        "Classes define two main things:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Attributes** (data) - What information the object will store\n",
        "2. **Behaviors** (methods) - What actions the object can perform\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objects: The Actual Characters\n",
        "\n",
        "An **object** is a specific instance created from a class blueprint. If the class is a blank character sheet, then objects are the completed sheets for Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. Each object has its own unique data, but they all follow the same basic structure defined by the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Cookie Cutter Analogy\n",
        "\n",

        "### Multiple Objects from One Class\n",
        "\n",
        "The power of classes becomes clear when you need multiple similar things. Instead of writing separate code for each character, you create one `Character` class and then make as many character objects as you need:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "// One class definition serves as the blueprint\n",
        "public class Character {\n",
        "    // Blueprint defines what ALL characters will have\n",
        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "// Many objects created from the same blueprint\n",

        "Character gimli = new Character();      // Object #3\n",
        "Character gandalf = new Character();    // Object #4\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Each object gets its own separate copy of the data defined in the class. Aragorn's health is completely independent of Legolas's health, even though they're both Character objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why This Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding the class-object relationship is crucial because:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Efficiency**: Write the template once, create unlimited instances\n",
        "- **Consistency**: All characters follow the same rules and structure\n",
        "- **Independence**: Each character object maintains its own unique state\n",
        "- **Scalability**: Easy to create parties of 4 heroes or armies of 1000 NPCs\n",

        "\n",
        "Now it's time to roll up your sleeves and create your first class! Just like designing a new character sheet for a homebrew D&D campaign, creating a class requires thoughtful planning about what information you need to store and what actions your characters should be able to perform.\n",

        "### Basic Class Anatomy\n",
        "\n",
        "Every **class declaration** in Java follows a specific structure. Think of it as the header section of a character sheet where you declare \"this is a character sheet\" before filling in the details:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public class Character {\n",
        "    // Class contents go here\n",

        "- **`class`** - The keyword that tells Java \"this is a class definition\"  \n",
        "- **`Character`** - The name of our class (always capitalized in Java)\n",
        "- **`{ }`** - Curly braces contain everything that belongs to this class\n",
        "\n",
        "### Class Naming Conventions\n",
        "\n",
        "Java has specific rules for naming classes that every programmer follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Start with a capital letter**: `Character`, not `character`\n",
        "2. **Use PascalCase**: `CharacterSheet`, `MagicItem`, `DungeonMaster`\n",
        "3. **Choose descriptive names**: `Character` is better than `C` or `Thing`\n",
        "4. **Avoid Java keywords**: Can't use `class`, `public`, `static`, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Planning Your Character Attributes\n",
        "\n",
        "Before writing code, think about what information every character needs. In D&D, this might include:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Attribute | Data Type | Example Value | Purpose |\n",
        "|-----------|-----------|---------------|---------|\n",
        "| Name | `String` | \"Aragorn\" | Character identification |\n",

        "public class Character {\n",
        "    // Instance variables will go here\n",

        "You might wonder why we're starting with an empty class instead of jumping straight to a complete implementation. This approach mirrors good D&D campaign design:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Foundation first**: Establish the basic structure before adding complexity\n",
        "- **Test early**: Make sure the basic framework works before adding features\n",

        "\n",
        "Each class typically lives in its own file, with the filename matching the class name:\n",

        "- File name: `Character.java`\n",
        "- Location: Same folder as your main program\n",

        "\n",
        "You might have noticed the word `public` in our class declaration. This is called a **visibility modifier**, and it controls who can use your class. We'll dive deeper into visibility modifiers soon, but for now, know that `public` means other classes can create Character objects.\n",

        "Think of visibility like access levels in a D&D campaign:\n",

        "When you use `new`, you're telling Java: \"Take this class blueprint and create a real, working object from it.\" The process is similar to rolling dice for a new D&D character - you're taking the general rules and creating a specific instance with its own unique identity.\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "// The magic happens here\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **`Character`** (left side) - The data type we're creating\n",
        "2. **`hero`** - The variable name that will refer to our object\n",
        "3. **`=`** - Assignment operator\n",

        "### Memory Allocation Behind the Scenes\n",
        "\n",
        "When you use `new`, Java performs several important tasks automatically:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Allocates memory** for the new object\n",
        "2. **Creates space** for all instance variables\n",
        "3. **Initializes variables** to their default values\n",
        "4. **Calls the constructor** to set up the object properly\n",
        "5. **Returns a reference** to the newly created object\n",

        "- Pulls out a fresh character sheet (allocates memory)\n",

        "\n",
        "**Constructor overloading** allows you to create multiple constructors in the same class, each accepting different parameters.

        "**Getter methods** are public methods that provide controlled access to private instance variables. Think of them as the guild's information desk - they let authorized people request specific information about a character without giving them direct access to the private character sheet itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What are Getter Methods?\n",
        "\n",
        "Since we made our instance variables `private`, other classes can no longer access them directly. Getter methods solve this problem by providing a **controlled way** to read private data without compromising security:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public class Character {\n",
        "    private String name;\n",
        "    private int health;\n",
        "    \n",

        "\n",
        "### Why Getters Instead of Direct Access?\n",
        "\n",
        "Getter methods provide several important advantages over public fields:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Control**: Add validation or formatting before returning data\n",
        "- **Future Flexibility**: Change internal implementation without breaking other code  \n",

        "System.out.println(name + \" has \" + health + \" HP\");\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Advanced Getter Techniques\n",
        "\n",
        "Getters can do more than just return raw field values - they can provide calculated or formatted information:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public String getStatusDescription() {\n",
        "    if (health <= 0) return \"Dead\";\n",

        "\n",
        "Create a main method that demonstrates your magic item shop system:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
        "    System.out.println(\"=== MYSTICAL TREASURES MAGIC SHOP ===\");\n",
        "    \n",
        "    // Create inventory using different constructors\n",
        "    ArrayList<MagicItem> inventory = new ArrayList<>();\n",

        "Your main method should demonstrate:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Constructor Overloading**: Create items using both constructors\n",
        "2. **Collections Integration**: Add/remove items from ArrayList inventory\n",
        "3. **toString() Usage**: Print individual items and entire inventory\n",
        "4. **equals() Testing**: Compare items and test contains() method\n",
        "5. **Static Methods**: Use rollPrice() and getTotalItems()\n",
        "6. **Encapsulation**: Show validation preventing invalid data\n",
        "7. **Action Methods**: Demonstrate appraisal, depreciation, and upgrades\n",
        "\n",
        "### Sample Output Format\n",

        "1. **Inventory Analytics**: Find most/least valuable items, calculate profit margins\n",
        "2. **Random Item Generator**: Static method to create items with random properties\n",
        "3. **Rarity Distribution**: Ensure shop has balanced mix of common to legendary items\n",
        "4. **Item Categories**: Track different types (weapons, armor, consumables, etc.)\n",
        "5. **Customer System**: Create a simple customer class that can buy items\n",
        "\n",
        "### Getting Started Tips\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic MagicItem class, then add features incrementally\n",
        "2. **Test Frequently**: Create simple test cases for each method as you write it\n",
        "3. **Use Your Tools**: Take advantage of toString() and equals() for debugging\n",
        "4. **Validate Input**: Remember to check for invalid data in constructors and setters\n",
        "5. **Think Like a Shopkeeper**: Consider what operations a real magic shop would need\n",
