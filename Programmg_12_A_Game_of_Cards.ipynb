        "In this stage, we'll create a simple class called CardSimple to represent a playing card.\n",
        "\n",
        "To represent rank and suit, we'll use integers. This choice keeps our code simple and avoids the need for more complex data types at this stage. Ranks will be represented by integers 1-13, where 1 is Ace, 11 is Jack, 12 is Queen, and 13 is King. This mapping is intuitive and easy to remember. Similarly, suits will be represented by integers 1-4, where 1 is Clubs, 2 is Diamonds, 3 is Hearts, and 4 is Spades. Again, this mapping is straightforward and easy to work with.\n",
        "\n",
        "The CardSimple class will have two instance variables: rank and suit, both of type int. Instance variables are declared within the class but outside any method. They represent the state of an object and can be accessed by any method within the class. By declaring rank and suit as instance variables, each CardSimple object will have its own copy of these variables, allowing us to create multiple unique cards.\n",
        "\n",
        "To initialize the rank and suit of a card, we'll create a constructor that takes rank and suit as parameters. A constructor is a special method that is called when a new object is created. It has the same name as the class and is used to initialize the object's state. The constructor parameters (rank and suit) allow us to assign initial values to the instance variables when creating a new CardSimple object. The this keyword is used to refer to the current object instance. It helps distinguish between the instance variables (this.rank and this.suit) and the constructor parameters (rank and suit).\n",
        "\n",
        "We will also include two basic getter methods, to retrieve the cards rnand and suit respectively. We will NOT provide setter methods, as we want our cards to be **immutable** (that is, a given card cannot change its suit).\n",
        "\n",
        "For testing purposes, we'll include a main method within the CardSimple class. The main method is the entry point of a Java program. It's where the execution of the program begins. In the main method, we'll create a few CardSimple objects with different rank and suit values to test our class. We'll use System.out.println to print the rank and suit of each card, allowing us to verify that the objects are created correctly.\n",

        "\n",
        "n our previous exploration, we created a simple CardSimple class to represent a playing card using integers for rank and suit. While the CardSimple class provided a basic foundation, we can enhance it further to create a more robust and flexible Card class. In this introduction, we'll delve into the key concepts and techniques used in expanding the CardSimple class, which will help new Java developers understand the reasoning behind our design decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Static Array Variables for Ranks and Suits\n",
        "In the CardSimple class, we used integers to represent ranks and suits. However, in the Card class, we can leverage arrays to store the string representations of ranks and suits. The RANKS array contains the names of the ranks (e.g., \"Ace\", \"2\", \"3\", ..., \"King\"), and the SUITS array contains the names of the suits (e.g., \"Clubs\", \"Diamonds\", \"Hearts\", \"Spades\"). By using arrays, we establish a direct mapping between the integer values of rank and suit and their corresponding string representations. This allows us to easily retrieve the name of a rank or suit based on its integer value, making our code more readable and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can further enhance the Card class by storing these as **static variables**. Instead of using integer constants for suits and ranks, we define two static String arrays: `RANKS` and `SUITS`. Static variables belong to the class itself, rather than instances of the class. They are shared among all instances of the class and can be accessed using the class name. By declaring `RANKS` and `SUITS` as static, we ensure that there is only one copy of these arrays, which is shared by all Card objects. This is an efficient way to store the string representations of ranks and suits, as it avoids duplicating the data for each card.\n",

In Java, the `toString` method is a special method that returns a string representation of an object. By default, it returns a string containing the object's class name and hash code. However, we can override this method to provide a more meaningful string representation for our Card objects. In our implementation, we override `toString` to return a string in the format \"Rank of Suit\" (e.g., \"Ace of Spades\"). This makes it easier to display and understand the value of a card when printing it or using it in string concatenation.\n",

        "One of the enhancements we can make to the Card class is the overriding of the `equals` method. In Java, the `equals` method is used to determine whether two objects are considered equal based on their state. By default, the `equals` method compares the memory addresses of objects, which is not suitable for comparing the contents of objects. By overriding `equals`, we can provide a custom equality comparison specific to our Card class. In our implementation, we consider two cards equal if they have the same rank and suit. We first check if the objects being compared are the same object (this == obj), which is an optimization for self-comparison. Then, we check if the other object is null or if it's not an instance of the Card class. If either of these conditions is true, we return false since the objects cannot be equal. Finally, we cast the other object to a Card and compare the rank and suit values.\n",

        "#### Making Cards Comparable\n",
        "Another enhancement in the Card class is the implementation of the `Comparable` interface and the overriding of the `compareTo` method. The `Comparable` interface is a built-in interface in Java that allows objects to be compared to each other. By implementing this interface, we define a natural ordering for cards based on their rank. In our implementation, we compare cards based on their rank only. The `compareTo` method takes another Card object as a parameter and returns an integer indicating whether the current card is less than, equal to, or greater than the other card. If the current card's rank is less than the other card's rank, we return a negative integer. If the ranks are equal, we return 0. If the current card's rank is greater than the other card's rank, we return a positive integer.\n",

        "### From the Card Class to the DeckSimple Class\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we have a well-defined `Card` class that represents individual playing cards, let's move on to creating a `DeckSimple` class that represents a basic deck of 52 cards. The `DeckSimple` class will build upon the functionality provided by the `Card` class and encapsulate the behavior of a complete deck.\n",
        "\n",
        "When designing the `DeckSimple` class, we need to consider the attributes and methods that are necessary to represent and manipulate a deck of cards effectively. Let's go through the design process step by step.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Choosing Attributes\n",
        "\n",
        "-   We need a way to store the collection of `Card` objects that make up the deck. We can use an array or an `ArrayList` to hold the cards. An `ArrayList` is a good choice because it provides dynamic resizing and convenient methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements.\n",
        "-   We should keep track of the number of cards remaining in the deck. This information can be useful for determining if the deck is empty or how many cards are left to be dealt.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Defining Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "1. We need a constructor to initialize a new `DeckSimple` object. The constructor should create a standard deck of 52 cards by iterating over all possible combinations of ranks and suits and adding a `Card` object for each combination to the deck.\n",
        "2.  A method to shuffle the cards in the deck is essential. We can use the built-in `Collections.shuffle()` method to randomly shuffle the elements of the `ArrayList` that holds the cards.\n",
        "3. We need a method to draw the top card from the deck. This method should remove and return the card at the top of the deck. If the deck is empty, it should handle the situation gracefully.\n",
        "4.  A method to check if the deck is empty can be useful. It should return `true` if the deck has no cards remaining, and `false` otherwise.\n",
        "5. A method to get the number of cards remaining in the deck can provide additional information about the state of the deck.\n",
        "6. Overriding the `toString()` method allows us to provide a string representation of the deck, which can be helpful for debugging and displaying the contents of the deck.\n",
        "\n",
        "By carefully considering the attributes and methods needed for the `DeckSimple` class, we can create a class that encapsulates the behavior of a basic deck of cards. The `DeckSimple` class will be responsible for creating a standard deck, shuffling the cards, drawing cards from the deck, and providing information about the state of the deck.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using an `ArrayList` to store the `Card` objects allows us to leverage the built-in methods provided by the `ArrayList` class, such as `add()`, `remove()`, `isEmpty()`, and `size()`. This simplifies the implementation of the `DeckSimple` class and makes it more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "By encapsulating the deck-related functionality within the `DeckSimple` class, we achieve a clear separation of concerns. The `Card` class focuses on representing individual cards, while the `DeckSimple` class handles the operations and behavior related to a complete deck of cards."
