        "Welcome to our Java programming adventure! In this series of exercises, we'll be building a War card game step by step, exploring the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) along the way. By the end of this journey, you'll have a solid understanding of Java classes, methods, and OOP principles, and you'll have created a fully functional game.\n",
        "\n",
        "The War card game is a classic two-player game where players compete to win all the cards. In our version, we'll have two players, Ada and Alan, battling it out with their deck of cards. The game rules are simple:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  The deck is divided evenly between Ada and Alan.\n",
        "2.  In each round, both players reveal the top card of their deck simultaneously.\n",
        "3.  The player with the higher-value card wins the round and takes both cards.\n",
        "4.  If the cards have the same value, it's a \"war.\" Each player places seven face-down cards from their stack, and then they reveal the eighth card. The player with the higher-value eighth card wins all the cards played in the war. If the eighth cards are also the same value, the war continues until one player wins the turn.\n",
        "5.  The game ends when one player has collected all the cards.\n",
        "\n",
        "To build our War game, we'll create several classes that represent different components of the game. We'll start with a simple version of each class and then progressively enhance them to demonstrate various OOP concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an overview of the classes we'll be building:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  `CardSimple`: Represents a basic playing card with a rank.\n",
        "2.  `Card`: An enhanced version of CardSimple with additional properties and methods.\n",
        "3.  `Deck`: Manages a collection of Card objects.\n",
        "4.  `WarSimple`: Implements the basic gameplay logic for a single battle\n",
        "5.  `WarGame`: The complete War game implementation using the enhanced Card and Deck classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout the exercises, we'll explore essential OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. We'll discuss how to define classes, create objects, and implement methods to achieve the desired functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "By breaking down the game into smaller components and building them incrementally, we'll gain a deep understanding of how OOP concepts are applied in practice. You'll learn how to design and structure your code using classes, how to interact with objects, and how to create reusable and maintainable code.\n"

        "## Our First Class - `CardSimple`\n",
        "In object-oriented programming (OOP), **classes** serve as blueprints for creating **objects**. They define the properties (**attributes**) and behaviors (**methods**) that objects of that class will possess. Let's dive into the CardSimple class and explore the fundamental concepts it demonstrates.\n",
        "\n",
        "The CardSimple class represents a basic playing card with two properties: rank and suit. The rank represents the value of the card (e.g., Ace, 2, 3, ..., King), while the suit represents the category of the card (e.g., Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades). In this simple implementation, we use integers to represent both rank and suit.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The class begins with the declaration `public class CardSimple`, which tells Java that we are defining a new class named CardSimple. The `public` keyword indicates that this class can be accessed from anywhere in the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Inside the class, we have two instance variables: `rank` and `suit`, both of type `int`. **Instance variables** are attributes that belong to each individual object created from the class. Each CardSimple object will have its own values for `rank` and `suit`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Next, we have a **constructor** method named `CardSimple`. Constructors are special methods that are called when creating a new object of the class. They initialize the object's instance variables. In this case, the constructor takes two parameters: `rank` and `suit`, which are used to set the initial values of the corresponding instance variables using the `this` keyword. The `this` keyword refers to the current object instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "  By providing a constructor that accepts the rank and suit values, we ensure that each CardSimple object is created with specific values for its properties. This promotes encapsulation, a key principle of OOP, by bundling the data (rank and suit) together with the object that owns it.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. In the `main` method, which is the entry point of the program, we demonstrate how to create and use CardSimple objects. We create three CardSimple objects named `card1`, `card2`, and `card3`, each with different rank and suit values. The `new` keyword is used to instantiate a new object by calling the constructor with the appropriate arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Finally, we print the rank and suit of each card using `System.out.println()`. We access the `rank` and `suit` instance variables of each card object directly, as they have default access within the same class.\n",
        "\n",
        "This simple implementation of the CardSimple class provides a foundation for representing playing cards in our War game. However, there are some design choices we might consider:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Using integers to represent rank and suit may not be the most intuitive or readable approach. We could use enums or constants to provide more meaningful names for the rank and suit values.\n",
        "2.  The current implementation allows direct access to the `rank` and `suit` instance variables from outside the class. To promote encapsulation and data integrity, we could make these variables private and provide getter methods to access their values.\n",
        "3.  We could add more methods to the CardSimple class to provide additional functionality, such as comparing cards or determining the winner of a battle.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we progress through the exercises, we'll explore these design choices and evolve our Card class to incorporate better practices and functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the next section, we'll implement the Card class, which will build upon the concepts introduced in CardSimple and introduce new OOP principles."

        "## A Complete `Card`\n",
        "In this section, we'll dive deeper into the enhanced Card class and explore the various Java concepts it incorporates. This class builds upon the ideas introduced in the CardSimple class and introduces several new features that showcase the power and flexibility of object-oriented programming in Java.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implementing an Interface\n",
        "An interface in Java is a contract that specifies a set of methods that a class must implement. By implementing an interface, a class agrees to provide implementations for all the methods declared in the interface. In the Card class, we implement the `Comparable<Card>` interface, which defines a single method called `compareTo`. This method is used to compare two objects of the same type and determine their relative order.\n",
        "\n",
        "By implementing the Comparable interface, we ensure that Card objects can be compared to each other based on their rank and suit. This is useful when we need to sort cards or determine the winner of a battle in our War game. The `compareTo` method returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer if the current card is less than, equal to, or greater than the other card, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Static Final Variables\n",
        "In the Card class, we introduce two `static final` arrays: `RANKS` and `SUITS`. The `static` keyword means that these arrays belong to the class itself, rather than individual instances of the class. This allows all Card objects to share the same rank and suit information, saving memory and ensuring consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `final` keyword indicates that the values of these arrays cannot be modified once they are initialized. This is important because we want the rank and suit information to remain constant throughout the program's execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using static final arrays for ranks and suits provides several benefits. It improves code readability by providing meaningful names for the rank and suit values, making the code easier to understand. It also allows us to easily update the rank and suit information in a single place if needed, without having to modify each individual card object.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Encapsulation and Access Control\n",
        "Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming, and it involves bundling data and methods together within a class and controlling access to them. In the Card class, we achieve encapsulation by declaring the `rank` and `suit` instance variables as `private`. This means that these variables can only be accessed within the Card class itself, and not from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "By making the instance variables private, we prevent unauthorized modification of the card's rank and suit from other parts of the program. This ensures data integrity and maintains the internal consistency of the Card objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "To provide controlled access to the rank and suit values, we introduce **getter&& methods: `getRank()` and `getSuit()`. These methods allow other parts of the program to retrieve the values of the rank and suit variables without directly accessing them. This way, we maintain encapsulation while still providing necessary access to the card's information.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Method Overriding.\n",
        "Method overriding is a feature in Java where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. In the Card class, we override several methods inherited from the Object class, which is the ultimate superclass of all classes in Java.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -   `compareTo`: We override this method from the Comparable interface to define how two Card objects should be compared based on their rank and suit. By providing our own implementation, we specify the comparison logic that is specific to the Card class.\n",
        "  -   `equals`: We override the `equals` method to determine if two Card objects are equal based on their rank and suit. By default, the `equals` method in the Object class compares object references, but we want to compare the actual content of the Card objects. Our implementation checks if the rank and suit of two cards are the same, providing a more meaningful equality comparison.\n",
        "  -   `toString`: We override the `toString` method to provide a string representation of a Card object. Instead of returning the default object reference, we use the `RANKS` and `SUITS` arrays to create a readable format (e.g., \"A♠\" for the Ace of Spades). This allows us to easily print and display Card objects in a human-readable format.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Type Casting\n",
        "In the `equals` method, we encounter type casting, which is a way to convert an object from one type to another. Before comparing the current Card object with another object, we first need to ensure that the other object is also of type Card. We use the `getClass()` method to check the class of the other object.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the other object is indeed of type Card, we need to cast it from the general Object type to the specific Card type. This is done using the `(Card)` syntax. After casting, we can access the `rank` and `suit` instance variables of the other Card object to perform the equality comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "Type casting allows us to treat an object of a general type as an object of a more specific type, enabling us to access its specific properties and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Testing with `main`\n",
        "To demonstrate the usage and functionality of the Card class, we include a `main` method within the class. In the `main` method, we create three Card objects with different rank and suit values. We then print these objects using the `toString` method, which returns a string representation of each card.\n",
        "\n",
        "The enhanced Card class introduces several important Java concepts, including interfaces, static final variables, encapsulation, method overriding, and type casting. These concepts work together to create a robust and flexible representation of a playing card, with well-defined behavior and encapsulated data.\n",
        "\n",
        "By understanding and applying these concepts, we can create classes that are modular, maintainable, and adhere to the principles of object-oriented programming. The Card class serves as a foundation for building more complex components of our War game, such as the deck and the game logic itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the next section, we'll explore the Deck class, which will utilize the Card class to represent a collection of cards and provide functionality for shuffling and dealing cards in our game."

        "### Dealing Cards with Deck\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, we'll explore the Deck class, which represents a simplified version of a deck of playing cards. The Deck class builds upon the Card class we discussed earlier and demonstrates how to create and manipulate a collection of cards using Java's built-in ArrayList and Collections classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "###  ArrayLists of Cards\n",
        "The Deck class utilizes an ArrayList to store the Card objects that make up the deck. An ArrayList is a dynamic array implementation in Java that allows us to store objects of a specific type. It provides methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements in the list.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the Deck class, we declare a private instance variable called `cards` of type `List<Card>`. This variable will hold the Card objects that constitute the deck. By using an ArrayList, we can easily add and remove cards from the deck as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Constructors for New Decks\n",
        "The Deck class has a constructor that initializes the deck with 52 cards. It creates one Card object for each combination of suit and rank, representing a standard deck of playing cards.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inside the constructor, we use nested loops to iterate through each suit (1 to 4) and each rank (1 to 13). For each combination, we create a new Card object using the `new Card(rank, suit)` syntax and add it to the `cards` ArrayList using the `add()` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of the constructor, the `cards` ArrayList will contain 52 Card objects, representing a complete deck of cards.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Shuffling the Deck\n",
        "The `shuffle()` method in the Deck class is responsible for shuffling the order of the cards in the deck. It uses the built-in `Collections.shuffle()` method, which randomly permutes the elements in the specified list.\n",
        "\n",
        "By calling `Collections.shuffle(cards)`, we shuffle the order of the Card objects in the `cards` ArrayList. This simulates the act of shuffling a physical deck of cards, ensuring that the cards are in a random order for each new game.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Drawing a Card\n",
        "The `drawCard()` method allows us to draw the top card from the deck. It removes and returns the last Card object in the `cards` ArrayList, simulating the act of drawing a card from the top of the deck.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before drawing a card, we first check if the deck is not empty using the `isEmpty()` method. If the deck is not empty, we remove the last Card object from the `cards` ArrayList using `cards.remove(cards.size() - 1)` and return it. If the deck is empty, we return `null` to indicate that there are no more cards to draw.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Checking the Status of the Deck\n",
        "The `isEmpty()` method is used to check if the deck is empty, meaning there are no more cards left to draw. It returns `true` if the `cards` ArrayList is empty and `false` otherwise. This method is useful for determining when the deck needs to be reshuffled or when the game should end because there are no more cards available.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, the `remainingCards()` method returns the number of cards currently in the deck. It uses the `size()` method of the ArrayList to get the number of elements in the `cards` list.  This method is helpful for keeping track of how many cards are left in the deck during the game and for determining the progress of the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Testing the Deck Class\n",
        "The `main()` method within the Deck class demonstrates the usage and functionality of the class. It creates a new Deck object, prints the initial unshuffled deck, shuffles the deck using the `shuffle()` method, and then prints the shuffled deck.\n",
        "\n",
        "We also override the `toString()` to provide a string representation of the deck. It returns a string that contains all the cards in the deck, using the `toString()` method of the `cards` ArrayList. This method allows us to easily print and display the contents of the deck for debugging or informational purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Deck class showcases the use of Java's built-in ArrayList and Collections classes to manage a collection of objects. It demonstrates how to create and manipulate a list of Card objects, perform operations like shuffling and drawing cards, and provide useful methods for interacting with the deck."

        "## Introduction to the WarSimple Class\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, we'll explore the WarSimple class, which represents a simplified version of the War card game. The WarSimple class demonstrates the basic gameplay mechanics of the War game, including distributing cards to players, resolving a single war round, and determining the winner.\n",
        "\n",
        "The WarSimple class utilizes the Card and Deck classes we discussed earlier to manage the cards and the deck. It also introduces some new syntax and concepts, which we'll explain in detail.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Instance Variables and Constructors\n",
        "The WarSimple class has three instance variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   `adaHand`: A List of Card objects representing Ada's hand of cards.\n",
        "-   `alanHand`: A List of Card objects representing Alan's hand of cards.\n",
        "-   `deck`: An instance of the Deck class representing the deck of cards used in the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "These instance variables are used to keep track of each player's cards and the main deck throughout the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "The constructor of the WarSimple class initializes the game by creating a new Deck object, shuffling the deck to ensure random distribution of cards, and initializing the `adaHand` and `alanHand` as empty ArrayLists.\n",
        "\n",
        "After initializing the deck and hands, the constructor calls the `distributeInitialCards()` method to distribute an equal number of cards to each player, preparing them for a war round.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Distributing Initial Cards\n",
        "The `distributeInitialCards()` method is responsible for distributing an equal number of cards to each player at the start of the game. In this simplified version, we assume each player gets 2 cards: one for the war round and one as a back-up card in case of a tie.\n",
        "\n",
        "The method uses a `for` loop to iterate twice, representing the distribution of cards to each player. Inside the loop, it checks if the deck is not empty using the `!deck.isEmpty()` condition. If the deck is not empty, it draws a card from the deck using `deck.drawCard()` and adds it to Ada's hand (`adaHand`) and Alan's hand (`alanHand`) respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Resolving a Single War\n",
        "The `resolveSingleWar()` method simulates a single war round between the two players. It first checks if both players have at least one card in their hands using the condition `adaHand.size() < 1 || alanHand.size() < 1`. If either player doesn't have enough cards, it prints a message and returns, ending the war round.\n",
        "\n",
        "If both players have cards, the method removes the top card from each player's hand using `adaHand.remove(0)` and `alanHand.remove(0)`, and stores them in variables `adaWarCard` and `alanWarCard` respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "The removed cards are then added to a new ArrayList called `warPile`, which represents the pile of cards played in the war round.\n",
        "\n",
        "The method then compares the rank of the war cards using `adaWarCard.getRank()` and `alanWarCard.getRank()` to determine the winner of the war round. If Ada's card has a higher rank, she wins the war, and all the cards in the `warPile` are added to her hand using `adaHand.addAll(warPile)`. Similarly, if Alan's card has a higher rank, he wins the war, and the cards are added to his hand.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the ranks of the war cards are equal, it's a tie, and the method prints a message indicating that there are no more cards to continue another war round.\n",
        "\n",
        "### ArrayList Methods\n",
        "As just mentioned, the WarSimple class uses several ArrayList methods to manipulate the players' hands and the war pile:\n",
        "-   `add()`: Adds a single card to the end of the ArrayList.\n",
        "-   `addAll()`: Adds all the cards from another ArrayList to the end of the current ArrayList.\n",
        "-   `remove(0)`: Removes the first card (at index 0) from the ArrayList and returns it.\n",
        "-   `size()`: Returns the number of cards in the ArrayList.\n",
        "\n",
        "These methods allow us to add and remove cards from the players' hands and the war pile efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Boolean Tests\n",
        "The WarSimple class uses boolean tests to make decisions based on certain conditions:\n",
        "-   `!deck.isEmpty()`: Checks if the deck is not empty. The `!` operator negates the result of `deck.isEmpty()`, so if the deck is empty, it returns `false`, and if the deck is not empty, it returns `true`.\n",
        "-   `adaHand.size() < 1 || alanHand.size() < 1`: Checks if either Ada's hand or Alan's hand has less than one card. The `||` operator represents a logical OR, so if either condition is true, the overall result is `true`.\n",
        "\n",
        "These boolean tests help control the flow of the game and ensure that certain actions are only performed when the necessary conditions are met.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the next section, we'll put this altogether into a complete game."

        "In this section, we'll explore the WarGame class, which represents a complete implementation of the War card game. The War card game is a simple two-player game where the objective is to win all the cards. Let's start by discussing the rules of the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Rules of War\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  The deck is shuffled and dealt evenly to two players, face-down.\n",
        "2.  Each player reveals the top card of their deck simultaneously.\n",
        "3.  The player with the higher-value card wins the round and takes both cards, placing them at the bottom of their deck.\n",
        "4.  If the revealed cards have the same value, it's a \"war.\" Each player places seven face-down cards (if available) and then one face-up card. The player with the higher face-up card wins all the cards played in the war.\n",
        "5.  If another tie occurs during a war, the process repeats until one player wins the war.\n",
        "6.  The game continues until one player runs out of cards, at which point the other player is declared the winner.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Pseudocode\n",
        "Now, let's see how we can use Java to implement these rules and create a playable War card game.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Game Setup:\n",
        "    -   We'll create a Deck object to represent the deck of cards.\n",
        "    -   Each player, Ada and Alan, will have their own hand of cards represented by an ArrayList of Card objects.\n",
        "    -   The deck will be shuffled to ensure a random distribution of cards.\n",
        "    -   The cards will be evenly distributed to the players' hands.\n",
        "2.  Playing a Round:\n",
        "    -   In each round, both players reveal the top card of their hand.\n",
        "    -   We'll remove the top card from each player's hand and compare their ranks.\n",
        "    -   The player with the higher-value card wins the round and takes both cards, adding them to the bottom of their hand.\n",
        "    -   If the revealed cards have the same rank, a war occurs.\n",
        "3.  Handling a War:\n",
        "    -   When a war occurs, each player places seven face-down cards (if available) and then one face-up card.\n",
        "    -   We'll create a separate list to store the cards played in the war.\n",
        "    -   If either player doesn't have enough cards to complete the war, they lose the war, and the other player takes all the cards played.\n",
        "    -   If both players have enough cards, we compare the face-up cards to determine the winner of the war.\n",
        "    -   If another tie occurs during the war, the process repeats until one player wins.\n",
        "4.  Game Flow:\n",
        "    -   The game continues round by round until one player runs out of cards.\n",
        "    -   We'll use a loop to keep playing rounds until either Ada's hand or Alan's hand is empty.\n",
        "    -   After each round, we'll increment a round counter to keep track of the number of rounds played.\n",
        "5.  Announcing the Winner:\n",
        "    -   Once the game loop ends, we'll check which player's hand is empty.\n",
        "    -   The player with the non-empty hand is declared the winner.\n",
        "\n",
        "The WarGame class will encompass all these aspects of the game. It will handle the initialization of the deck and player hands, manage the gameplay by playing rounds and handling wars, and determine the winner at the end of the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout the implementation, we'll utilize the Card and Deck classes to represent the cards and the deck, respectively. We'll also make use of various Java concepts such as loops, conditionals, ArrayLists, and method invocations to bring the game logic to life.\n",
        "\n",
        "By breaking down the game into smaller methods and utilizing object-oriented principles, we can create a modular and readable implementation of the War card game.\n",
