        "# Bowling for Interfaces\n",
        "### Brendan Shea, PhD\n",
        "\n",
        "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), we use classes to encapsulate data and behavior into reusable components. Classes define the properties (attributes) and methods (behaviors) of objects, and we can create instances of these classes to represent specific entities in our program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Java supports several fundamental concepts of OOP, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Encapsulation.** Bundling data and methods into a single unit (class) and controlling access to the internal state of an object.\n",
        "2.  **Inheritance.** Creating new classes based on existing classes, allowing for code reuse and hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
        "3.  **Polymorphism.** Treating objects of different classes as objects of a common superclass, enabling more flexible and modular code.\n",
        "4.  **Abstraction** Focusing on the essential features of an object and hiding unnecessary details, providing a simplified and generalized view of the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "These concepts help us create well-structured, maintainable, and extensible code. However, there are situations where we need to define a set of methods that are common to different classes, but these classes don't necessarily share a common superclass. This is where interfaces come into play.\n",
        "\n",
        "An interface in Java is a collection of abstract methods (methods without a body) and constant variables. It defines a contract that classes can implement, specifying a set of methods that the implementing classes must provide. Interfaces allow us to define common behavior that can be shared across different classes, regardless of their inheritance hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, let's introduce a case study to illustrate the concept of interfaces in Java. Imagine we're building a bowling alley management system inspired by the movie \"The Big Lebowski\". In this system, we have various classes representing different aspects of the bowling alley, such as `Bowler`, `Lane`, `Ball`, and `Score`.\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public  class  Bowler  {\n",
        "  private  String name;\n",
        "  private  int score;\n",
        "  // Constructor, getters, and setters  \n",
        "  }\n",
        "\n",
        "public  class  Lane  {\n",
        "  private  int number;\n",
        "  private  boolean isOccupied;\n",
        "  // Constructor, getters, and setters  \n",
        "  }\n",
        "\n",
        "public  class  Ball  {   \n",
        "  private  String color;   \n",
        "  private  int weight;\n",
        "  // Constructor, getters, and setters  \n",
        "  }\n",
        "\n",
        "public  class  Score  {   \n",
        "  private  int value;   \n",
        "  private  int frameNumber;\n",
        "  // Constructor, getters, and setters  \n",
        "  }\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "While these classes represent different entities in our system, they don't necessarily share a common superclass. However, we can identify a common behavior that some of these classes should have: the ability to reset their state.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, when a game is over, we might want to reset the `Bowler`'s score, the `Lane`'s occupied status, and the `Score` object's value and frame number. We can define this common behavior using an interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "To define an interface in Java, you use the `interface` keyword followed by the name of the interface. The proper syntax for defining an interface is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public  interface  InterfaceName  {    \n",
        "  // Method declarations   \n",
        "  returnType methodName(parameters);     \n",
        "  // Constant declarations   \n",
        "  dataType CONSTANT_NAME = value;  }\n",
        "```\n",
        "Here's an example of defining the `Resetable` interface:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public  interface  Resetable  {   \n",
        "  void  reset();  \n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, any class that needs to have the ability to reset its state can implement the `Resetable` interface and provide its own implementation of the `reset()` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public  class  Bowler  implements  Resetable  {\n",
        "     // ...\n",
        "     @Override   public  void  reset()  {  \n",
        "    score =  0;   }  \n",
        "    }\n",
        "public  class  Lane  implements  Resetable  {   \n",
        "  // ...\n",
        "  @Override   public  void  reset()  {  \n",
        "    isOccupied =  false;   }  \n",
        "    }\n",
        "public  class  Score  implements  Resetable  {   \n",
        "  // ...\n",
        "  @Override   \n",
        "  public  void  reset()  {  \n",
        "    value =  0;  \n",
        "    frameNumber =  1;   \n",
        "    }  \n",
        "    }\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "When a class implements an interface, it agrees to adhere to the contract defined by the interface. This has several implications:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  The class must provide implementations for all the methods declared in the interface. If a class fails to implement any of the interface methods, it will result in a compilation error.\n",
        "2.  The class can be treated as an instance of the interface type. This allows for polymorphism, where an object of the implementing class can be assigned to a variable of the interface type.\n",
        "3.  Implementing an interface enables loose coupling between classes. It allows classes to interact with each other based on the interface contract, rather than being tightly coupled to specific implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interfaces allow us to define a contract that classes can adhere to, promoting a clear and consistent structure across different classes. They enable us to write more modular and flexible code, as we can work with objects based on their interface rather than their specific class.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we continue exploring the bowling alley management system, we'll see how interfaces can help us create a well-designed and maintainable codebase, just like how the Dude abides by his own code and adapts to the various characters and situations he encounters in the movie."

However, in Java, a class can only have ONE abstract class as its \"parent.\" By contrast, a class can implement mutiple interfaces, so long as it follows the \"rules\" for each of them.
