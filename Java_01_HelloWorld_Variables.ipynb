        "Welcome to your first Java programming lesson! Today we're going to explore the basics of **Java programming** using examples from a coffee shop.\n",

        "- Perform basic **operations** with your data\n",
        "- Fix common beginner programming mistakes\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**Java** is a **programming language** - a way for humans to give instructions to computers. Think of it like learning a new language to communicate, except instead of talking to people, you're talking to computers!\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Facts About Java:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Created in 1995** by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle)\n",
        "- Java is about the same age as the first Starbucks outside of Seattle!\n",
        "\n",
        "**\"Write Once, Run Anywhere\"**\n",
        "- This is Java's famous motto\n",
        "- It means you can write a Java program on one type of computer (like a Mac) and it will run on other types of computers (like Windows or Linux) without changes\n",
        "- Just like how a coffee recipe works the same way whether you make it in New York or Tokyo!\n",
        "\n",
        "**Object-Oriented Programming Language**\n",
        "- Don't worry about what this means yet - we'll learn about it in future lessons\n",
        "- For now, just know that Java helps organize code in a way that makes sense to humans\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why is Java So Popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Reliable** - Java programs are stable and don't crash easily\n",
        "2. **Secure** - Java has built-in security features\n",
        "3. **Fast** - Java programs run quickly\n",
        "4. **Everywhere** - Java runs on billions of devices worldwide\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**Mobile Apps**\n",
        "- Many coffee shop apps for ordering and loyalty programs\n",

        "- Every opening brace `{` must have a matching closing brace `}`\n",
