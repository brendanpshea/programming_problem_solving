The language provides a robust mechanism to handle these exceptions gracefully, using try, except, and finally blocks.

        "\n",
        "File handling is a fundamental aspect of many programming tasks, enabling applications to persist data between sessions, interact with data files, and process user input or outputs. Python simplifies file operations through its built-in functions, allowing for efficient and straightforward file reading, writing, and manipulation. This section introduces the core concepts of file handling in Python, serving as a precursor to more structured data handling methods like CSV and JSON.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Opening Files\n",
        "\n",
        "The `open()` function is the gateway to file handling in Python. It returns a file object and is commonly used with two arguments: `filename` and `mode`.\n",
        "\n",
        "`file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")`\n",
        "\n",
        "#### File Modes\n",
        "\n",
        "-   \"r\" - Read: Default mode. Opens a file for reading.\n",
        "-   \"w\" - Write: Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist, and truncates the file to zero length if it does.\n",
        "-   \"a\" - Append: Opens a file for appending at the end without truncating it. Creates a new file if it does not exist.\n",

        "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is based on the syntax of JavaScript but is a text format that is completely language independent. JSON files are ideal for data interchange between a server and a web application or between different parts of an application. A JSON file typically has a `.json` extension and represents data structured in a hierarchy of objects and arrays. Objects are denoted by curly braces `{}` containing key-value pairs, where the key is a string, and the value can be a string, number, boolean, array, or another object. Arrays are ordered lists of values and are denoted by square brackets `[]`.\n",
