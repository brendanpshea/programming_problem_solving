        "# Further Into Functions: Libraries and Recursion\n",

        "This chapter delves into the more complex aspects of Python functions. Our goal is to go beyond the basics, providing a deeper understanding of how functions work in Python and how they can be used effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "We start by exploring the concept of libraries in Python. Libraries are collections of pre-written code that we can use to perform a variety of tasks without needing to write the code from scratch. We'll learn how to import and use key libraries like Turtle, Math, and Random.\n",
        "\n",
        "A significant part of this chapter is dedicated to recursive functions. These are functions that call themselves as part of their execution. We'll examine how they work, compare them to iterative functions, and discuss when it's appropriate to use them.\n",
        "\n",
        "The chapter also introduces the concept of the stack. This is an essential part of how functions operate, especially recursive ones. Understanding the stack will help us grasp why and how a stack overflow error occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we'll bring all these concepts together with a practical example. This will demonstrate how to integrate multiple libraries in a single Python program, using functions to create something greater than the sum of its parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid grasp of Python functions, both in theory and in practice, and be better equipped to use them in your programming projects.\n",

In Python, we create a function using the `def` keyword, followed by a unique function name and a set of parentheses which can contain parameters. These parameters act as inputs that the function can use.\n",
