## Required and Recommended Course Materials 📚

- All course materials will be made available free online through D2L.
- This course will require that you have reliable, regular internet access. Most assignments will require you use a PC, Mac, or Linux desktop or laptop (Android, iOS, or Chrome OS may have problems with lockdown browser or Colab).

## Grading and Course Policies 📊

### Grading Scale

- **A:** 90.0 and above
- **B:** 80.0-89.9
- **C:** 70.0-79.9
- **D:** 60.0-69.9
- **F:** Below 60.0

### Grade Breakdown

Your final grade is a weighted average of the following:

**Web-Proctored Quizzes (Online) OR In-Class Activities (F2F) - 20%**

Online students will have weekly, webcam-proctored quizzes (of multiple-choice and coding questions). Face-to-face students will have activities and quizzes.

**Annotated Readings on Perusall - 20%**

This will provide you with the opportunity to reflect on key ideas, events, and issues in computer science. They will be delivered in *Perusall* (see below).

**Final Project - 20%**

At the end of the class, you will develop and implement a project in Java.

**Two Exams - 40% total (20% each)**

Exams are delivered using Respondus Monitor, and will require a webcam to take.

### Attendance 📅

Students in face-to-face classes should attend class regularly, while online students are expected to participate in class discussions and activities. **If you miss more than one week consecutively or 1/4 of the total class sessions, you may receive a failing grade of FW.** This may endanger your ability to receive financial aid. With this in mind, you are responsible for withdrawing from the class if you decide not to continue. I am willing to make exceptions if circumstances require, but you must let me know about these promptly.

### Plagiarism and Academic Integrity ⚖️

Your work should be your own---please don't use your classmates, friends, parents, internet sites, etc., to help you write your papers or answer test questions. And when you do use outside sources, make sure to give appropriate citation and acknowledgment for any words, ideas, or arguments. If the preponderance of the evidence suggests cheating has occurred (that is, if the evidence indicates that this is *more likely than not*), you will receive a failing grade on the assignment. A second violation will lead to a failing grade for the course. Please also see the RCTC statement on academic integrity later in the syllabus.

### Policy on Generative AI 🤖

I encourage you to use generative AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, CoPilot, Claude, etc.) to help you understand class content when needed (and mastering these tools will be important to almost any career path), and to work on your own projects (I've used it in my own projects, including for this course!). However, the use of generative AI is **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN** when it comes to answering questions on quizzes or exams.

## Using Perusall 📝

Perusall is a digital platform for collaborative learning that allows you to annotate readings and engage with your classmates. We're using it because it encourages active reading, critical thinking, and class participation.

You'll access Perusall through links provided in our D2L-Brightspace course. Once you click on these links, you'll be directed to the readings assigned for our class.

For each reading, you'll need to post annotations. These can be questions, comments, replies to comments of others, or reflections. Make sure your annotations are thoughtful and constructive.

Your work on Perusall will be graded based mainly on:

- **Quality of Annotations:** Insightful, relevant comments and questions
- **Active Time:** The time you spend reading and annotating
- **Interaction:** How you engage with your classmates' annotations

Remember, Perusall is a space for constructive and respectful academic discussion. Your engagement here is a vital part of your learning.

## Policy on Late Work ⏰

**Please read the following *before* emailing me to request an extension on an assignment.**

If you miss a quiz or activity due to a brief sickness, work conflict, class trip, computer malfunction, wedding, auto problem, court date, funeral, sporting event, etc., you do NOT need to email me (though it's okay if you want to give me a heads up). Here are my policies for making up missed or late work:

1. Quizzes can be submitted up to two days late, with no loss of credit.

2. Perusall reading assignments can be submitted up to two days late for reduced credit. Credit declines "linearly" (basically, if you submit it one minute late, you get 99.9% of the credit; if you submit it 1.5 days late, you'll get almost no credit).

**I will make exceptions to these policies if you can demonstrate a genuine need.** Please talk to me if anything comes up that is preventing you from succeeding in class.

## Getting in Touch with Me 📧

The best way to get ahold of me is by email, which I will aim to respond to within ONE working day (for simple questions) or TWO working days (for more complex ones). I don't generally check email on the weekends or holidays. If you don't hear from me by then, please try emailing me again. To help me provide you with quick, effective feedback, here's a general template for what I expect in an email.

### Email Template

*Dear Brendan (or Professor Shea):*

*My name is [full name], and I'm a student in [this section] of [this class]. I had a question regarding [identify quiz, textbook chapter, etc. Be specific, and include a copy of anything I might need to answer your question, including the full problem text, if applicable]. Here's everything I've tried so far to figure out the answer for myself [looked at the syllabus, notes, textbook, etc.], and here's my best guess as to the answer. Could you help me by doing the following? [Be specific in what you are asking me to do.] [Feel free to include anything else you'd like here. I'm always happy when students send along ideas/links/whatever vaguely relating to ethics and philosophy!]*

As I rule, I will not respond to requests that you be exempted from class policies without very good reason (e.g., for late-work extensions outside the conditions outlined above), or to emails that lack basic identifying information (your full name, class, etc.). For long or complex questions, I highly encourage you to schedule an appointment so that we can talk (either in person or by phone). Oh, and please don't call me Mr. Shea (That's my dad!).

## Resources for Student Success 🎓

Some helpful resources at RCTC (all of which are included with your course tuition) include the following:

**Student Support Services/TRIO (SS 159)** provides academic support for first-generation and low-income college students, as well as those with documented disabilities.
