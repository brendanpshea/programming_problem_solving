        "### Brendan Shea, PhD\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to the exciting world of advanced object-oriented programming! Just as Pokemon trainers discover that their journey becomes more complex as they encounter legendary Pokemon, evolution mechanics, and type advantages, your programming journey is about to level up with powerful new concepts. In this chapter, we'll explore **inheritance**, **packages**, **polymorphism**, and **object references** using the rich Pokemon universe as our guide.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think about how Pokemon are organized in the real world: every Pokemon shares certain basic characteristics (they all have HP, can level up, and know moves), but each species has unique abilities and behaviors. Pikachu can use Thunder Shock, while Charizard can breathe fire. This natural hierarchy and specialization is exactly what inheritance allows us to model in our code.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What We'll Master in This Adventure\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to create sophisticated Pokemon systems that demonstrate:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Inheritance**: Building Pokemon class hierarchies where specialized Pokemon inherit common traits\n",
        "- **Packages**: Organizing your Pokemon by regions, types, or abilities across multiple files\n",
        "- **Polymorphism**: Creating Pokemon collections that work seamlessly with any Pokemon type\n",
        "- **Object References**: Understanding how Pokemon objects relate to each other in memory\n",
        "- **Object Copying**: Safely cloning Pokemon for breeding or backup teams\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why These Concepts Matter\n",
        "\n",
        "These advanced OOP concepts solve real programming challenges:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Challenge | Solution | Pokemon Example |\n",
        "|-----------|----------|-----------------|\n",
        "| Code duplication | Inheritance | All Pokemon share HP/level, but each has unique moves |\n",
        "| Large, messy files | Packages | Separate Electric, Fire, and Water Pokemon into different files |\n",
        "| Rigid, inflexible code | Polymorphism | Pokemon battle system works with any Pokemon type |\n",
        "| Data corruption | Proper copying | Safely backup Pokemon teams before risky battles |\n",
        "\n",
        "## Connection to Your Previous Knowledge\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember the Character class you built in Chapter 7? You created heroes with names, health, levels, and classes. Now imagine if you needed to create dozens of different character types - Knights, Wizards, Archers, Paladins - each with their own special abilities. Without inheritance, you'd end up copying and pasting similar code everywhere. With inheritance, you can create a base Hero class and then specialize it efficiently.\n",

        "- **Subclass/Child Class**: The class that inherits from another (like \"ElectricPokemon\" inheriting from \"Pokemon\")\n",
        "- **Package**: A way to organize related classes into separate namespaces and files\n",
        "- **Polymorphism**: The ability to treat objects of different types through a common interface\n",

        "## The Pokemon Family Tree: Understanding Inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is the cornerstone of advanced object-oriented programming, and Pokemon provide the perfect example of how it works in the real world. Just as every Pokemon species shares fundamental characteristics while having unique traits, **inheritance** allows us to create class hierarchies where specialized classes automatically receive the properties and behaviors of more general classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think about it: whether you're looking at Pikachu, Charizard, or Blastoise, they all have certain things in common. They all have HP (hit points), they can all level up, they all know moves, and they all belong to a trainer. But each also has specific abilities that make them unique - Pikachu has electric attacks, Charizard can fly and breathe fire, and Blastoise can withdraw into its shell.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Is Inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inheritance** is a programming mechanism that allows a new class (called a **subclass** or **child class**) to acquire the properties and methods of an existing class (called a **superclass** or **parent class**). The subclass automatically gets all the public and protected features of the parent class, and can then add its own specialized features or modify inherited behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The \"Is-A\" Relationship\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance models what programmers call an **\"is-a\" relationship**. This means the subclass is a specialized type of the superclass:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Pikachu **is-a** ElectricPokemon\n",
        "- ElectricPokemon **is-a** Pokemon  \n",
        "- Charizard **is-a** FirePokemon\n",
        "- FirePokemon **is-a** Pokemon\n",
        "\n",
        "This is different from a \"has-a\" relationship (composition). A Pokemon **has-a** move set, but a Pikachu **is-a** Pokemon.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Pokemon Inheritance Hierarchy Example\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how we might organize Pokemon using inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Pokemon (Base Class)\n",
        "├── ElectricPokemon\n",
        "│   ├── Pikachu\n",
        "│   ├── Raichu\n",
        "│   └── Voltorb\n",

        "    └── Lapras\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Real Pokemon Examples\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's see how this hierarchy translates to shared and unique traits:\n",
        "\n",

        "| Unique trait | ❌ None | ❌ None | ✓ Stores electricity in cheeks |\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits of Inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance provides several powerful advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Code Reuse**: Write common Pokemon behaviors once in the base class, use everywhere\n",
        "```java\n",
        "// Write once in Pokemon class\n",

        "}\n",
        "// Available automatically in Pikachu, Charizard, etc.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Logical Organization**: Classes are organized in a natural hierarchy that matches real-world relationships\n",
        "\n",
        "**Easier Maintenance**: Need to change how all Pokemon level up? Change it once in the Pokemon class\n",
        "\n",
        "**Extensibility**: Easy to add new Pokemon types without modifying existing code\n",
        "\n",
        "**Polymorphism Support**: Can treat all Pokemon the same way when needed (more on this later!)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Inheritance Terminology\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Superclass/Parent Class**: The class being inherited from (Pokemon)\n",
        "- **Subclass/Child Class**: The class that inherits (Pikachu)  \n",
        "- **Inheritance Chain**: The path from subclass to ultimate superclass (Pikachu → ElectricPokemon → Pokemon)\n",
        "- **Override**: When a subclass provides its own version of a parent method\n",
        "- **Extend**: The act of creating a subclass (Pikachu extends ElectricPokemon)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Inheritance vs Composition\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to understand when to use inheritance versus when to use composition:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Use Inheritance When**: There's a clear \"is-a\" relationship\n",

Think of access modifiers as different security clearances in the Pokemon world - some information is public knowledge, some is shared only within the Pokemon family, some stays within the region, and some remains completely private.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Four Access Levels\n",
        "\n",
        "Java provides four access modifiers that control who can access your class members:\n",

        "\n",
        "**Start Restrictive**: Begin with the most restrictive access level that works, then open up only when necessary. Most fields should be private with public getters/setters when needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Use Protected for Inheritance**: When designing parent classes, make fields and methods that subclasses need `protected` rather than `public`.\n",

        "public class Pokemon {\n",
        "    private String name;        // External access via getter\n",

        "### Common Mistakes\n",
        "\n",
        "**Over-exposure**: Making everything `public` when more restrictive access would be appropriate. Remember that `public` means \"this is part of my official interface\" - use it thoughtfully.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Under-exposure**: Making fields `private` when subclasses legitimately need access. If you're writing `protected` getter methods just so subclasses can access data, consider making the field `protected` instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inheritance Access Rules**: When overriding methods, you cannot make them less accessible than in the parent class. You can only maintain or increase accessibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public class Pokemon {\n",
        "    protected void levelUp() { }\n",

        "\n",

        "## Polymorphism: One Pokeball, Many Pokemon\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you're a Pokemon trainer with six Pokeballs on your belt. Each ball contains a different Pokemon - Pikachu, Charizard, Blastoise, Venusaur, Alakazam, and Machamp. Despite their differences, you can command any of them to attack, and each will respond with their own unique fighting style. This is **polymorphism** - the ability to treat different objects through a common interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is Polymorphism?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Polymorphism** (from Greek meaning \"many forms\") allows objects of different types to be treated as instances of a common parent type. The key insight is that while you treat them the same way, each object responds with its own specialized behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "Pokemon pokemon1 = new Pikachu(\"Sparky\");\n",
        "Pokemon pokemon2 = new Charizard(\"Blaze\");\n",
        "Pokemon pokemon3 = new Blastoise(\"Aqua\");\n",
        "\n",
        "// Same command, different behaviors\n",

        "pokemon3.attack(target);  // Water attack\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Even though all three variables are declared as `Pokemon` references, each calls its own specialized `attack()` method. This is the magic of polymorphism!\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dynamic Method Dispatch\n",
        "\n",
        "Java uses **dynamic method dispatch** to determine which method to call at runtime. When you call `pokemon1.attack()`, Java doesn't look at the reference type (`Pokemon`) - it looks at the actual object type (`Pikachu`) and calls the appropriate method.\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "Pokemon mystery = getRandomPokemon();  // Could return any Pokemon type\n",
        "mystery.attack(opponent);              // Calls the correct attack method\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The method resolution happens at runtime, not compile time. Java examines the actual object and finds the most specific version of the method in the inheritance hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Polymorphic Collections\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most powerful applications of polymorphism is creating collections that can hold different types of objects:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "ArrayList<Pokemon> team = new ArrayList<>();\n",

        "    p.attack(enemy);  // Each Pokemon attacks in their own way\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This loop works because every object in the list is guaranteed to have an `attack()` method (inherited from Pokemon), but each object provides its own implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Power of Polymorphic Design\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism enables you to write code that works with objects that don't even exist yet. Consider a battle system:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public class BattleArena {\n",

        "When you override `equals()`, you must follow certain rules:\n",
        "- **Reflexive**: `x.equals(x)` must be true\n",
        "- **Symmetric**: If `x.equals(y)` is true, then `y.equals(x)` must also be true\n",
        "- **Transitive**: If `x.equals(y)` and `y.equals(z)`, then `x.equals(z)` must be true\n",
        "- **Consistent**: Multiple calls should return the same result\n",
        "- **Null handling**: `x.equals(null)` should return false\n",
        "\n",
        "## hashCode() and equals()\n",
        "\n",
        "There's an important rule in Java: if two objects are equal according to `equals()`, they must have the same `hashCode()`. If you override `equals()`, you should also override `hashCode()`:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "@Override\n",
        "public int hashCode() {\n",
        "    return name.hashCode() + type.hashCode();\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This is crucial for Pokemon to work correctly in HashSet and HashMap collections.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Using getClass()\n",
        "\n",
        "The `getClass()` method tells you the actual runtime type of an object:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "Pokemon pokemon = new Pikachu(\"Sparky\");\n",
        "System.out.println(pokemon.getClass().getSimpleName());  // Prints: Pikachu\n",
        "\n",
        "if (pokemon.getClass() == Pikachu.class) {\n",
        "    System.out.println(\"This is definitely a Pikachu!\");\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This is different from `instanceof`, which returns true for parent classes too.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Object Methods in Collections\n",
        "\n",
        "Proper implementation of Object methods is essential for collections to work correctly:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "ArrayList<Pokemon> team = new ArrayList<>();\n",
        "team.add(new Pikachu(\"Sparky\"));\n",
        "\n",
        "// toString() makes this readable\n",
        "System.out.println(team);  // [Sparky (Level 5 Electric)]\n",
        "\n",
        "// equals() makes this work\n",
        "Pokemon searchFor = new Pikachu(\"Sparky\");\n",
        "boolean found = team.contains(searchFor);  // Uses equals()\n",
        "\n",
        "// hashCode() makes HashSet work properly\n",
        "HashSet<Pokemon> uniquePokemon = new HashSet<>();\n",
        "uniquePokemon.add(new Pikachu(\"Sparky\"));\n",
        "uniquePokemon.add(new Pikachu(\"Sparky\"));  // Won't add duplicate if equals() works\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Best Practices\n",
        "\n",
        "**Always override toString()**: It makes debugging and logging much easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Override equals() thoughtfully**: Consider what makes two Pokemon \"the same\" in your application.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Override hashCode() with equals()**: Essential for hash-based collections to work properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Use consistent criteria**: The same fields used in `equals()` should be used in `hashCode()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Object class provides the foundation that makes all Java objects work together in collections, comparisons, and string representations. By properly overriding these methods, you ensure your Pokemon behave correctly in all Java contexts!"
