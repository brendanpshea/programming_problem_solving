        "## Leveling Up Your Code - From Procedures to Objects\n",
        "\n",
        "So far, you've been writing Java programs using **procedural programming** - organizing your code with methods that process data stored in variables and arrays. You've probably written programs like a grade calculator, a number guessing game, or maybe even a simple text-based RPG. But as your programs grow larger, you might have noticed some frustrations:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Your main method is getting really long and complicated\n",
        "- You're using parallel arrays to track related information (like `String[] monsterNames`, `int[] monsterHealth`, `int[] monsterAttack`)\n",
        "- You're passing lots of parameters between methods\n",
        "- When you want to add a new feature, you have to modify code in many different places\n",
        "\n",
        "**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** solves these problems by letting us organize our code in a completely different way - one that mirrors how we think about things in the real world.\n",
        "\n",
        "## From Parallel Arrays to Objects\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's say you've been building a simple RPG game. With your current procedural approach, you might have code like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "// Procedural approach - what you've been doing\n",
        "String[] itemNames = {\"Sword\", \"Shield\", \"Potion\"};\n",
        "String[] itemTypes = {\"weapon\", \"armor\", \"consumable\"};\n",
        "int[] itemValues = {100, 75, 25};\n",
        "int[] itemWeights = {10, 15, 1};\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Managing these parallel arrays gets messy fast. What if you accidentally delete an element from one array but not the others? What if you need to sort items by value - how do you keep all the arrays synchronized?\n",
        "\n",
        "With OOP, we'll learn to create an **Item class** that keeps all this related information together:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "// Object-oriented approach - what you'll learn\n",
        "Item sword = new Item(\"Sword\", \"weapon\", 100, 10);\n",
        "Item shield = new Item(\"Shield\", \"armor\", 75, 15);\n",
        "Item potion = new Item(\"Potion\", \"consumable\", 25, 1);\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Each **object** (sword, shield, potion) contains all its own data, and we can work with them as single, cohesive units.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What You'll Learn in This Chapter\n",
        "\n",
        "In this chapter, you'll discover how to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Design and create classes** - blueprints for making objects\n",
        "2. **Define attributes and methods** within classes to represent data and behavior\n",
        "3. **Instantiate objects** from your classes using constructors\n",
        "4. **Protect your data** with encapsulation, getters, and setters\n",
        "5. **Work with collections of objects** using ArrayList instead of parallel arrays\n",
        "6. **Customize object behavior** with special methods like toString() and equals()\n",
        "\n",
        "## Building Your RPG the Object-Oriented Way\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this chapter, we'll transform a text-based RPG from a procedural mess into an elegant object-oriented design. You'll create:\n",
        "\n",
        "- An `Item` class for weapons, armor, and consumables\n",
        "- A `Monster` class for enemies with different abilities\n",
        "- A `Character` class for the player's hero\n",
        "- An `Inventory` system using ArrayList\n",
        "- A simple `Battle` system where objects interact\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end, instead of juggling dozens of variables and arrays, you'll have clean, organized code where each object manages its own state and behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Power of Thinking in Objects\n",
        "\n",
        "The key insight of OOP is this: instead of thinking about your program as a series of actions (procedures) that manipulate data, you think about it as a collection of **objects** that interact with each other. Each object:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Knows things** (has attributes/data)\n",
        "- **Does things** (has methods/behavior)\n",
        "- **Hides its complexity** (encapsulation)\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, a Monster object knows its own health, attack power, and name. It can attack a character, take damage, and determine if it's still alive. The rest of your program doesn't need to know exactly how the Monster stores this information or calculates damage - it just needs to know what the Monster can do.\n",
        "\n",
        "## A New Way of Problem-Solving\n",
        "\n",
        "Moving from procedural to object-oriented thinking requires a shift in how you approach problems:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Procedural thinking**: \"What steps do I need to perform?\"\n",
        "1. Check monster health\n",
        "2. Calculate player damage\n",
        "3. Subtract damage from health\n",
        "4. Check if monster is defeated\n",
        "\n",
        "**Object-oriented thinking**: \"What objects do I need and how do they interact?\"\n",
        "- A Monster that can take damage and report its status\n",
        "- A Character that can attack\n",
        "- A Battle that coordinates the interaction\n",
        "\n",
        "Both approaches can solve the same problems, but OOP becomes increasingly powerful as your programs grow in size and complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Ready to Level Up?\n",
        "\n",
        "You already have all the Java fundamentals you need - variables, methods, conditionals, loops, and arrays. Now you're ready to learn how to combine these tools in a new way that will make your programs more organized, flexible, and powerful.\n",
        "\n",

        "## Core Concepts - The Four Pillars of OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "Object-oriented programming rests on four fundamental concepts that work together to create powerful, flexible programs. Think of these as the core game mechanics of OOP - once you understand how each works, you can combine them to build amazing things.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Classes and Objects: Blueprints and Instances\n",
        "\n",
        "A **class** is like a blueprint or template that defines what something should be. An **object** is an actual instance created from that blueprint. This distinction is crucial to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think about it this way: in an RPG, you might have the concept of \"Monster\" (the class) and actual monsters like \"Goblin Scout\" or \"Dragon Lord\" (the objects). The class defines what all monsters have in common - health points, attack power, a name. The objects are the specific monsters your hero actually fights.\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "// Monster is the class - the blueprint\n",
        "class Monster {\n",
        "    // What every monster has\n",
        "    String name;\n",
        "    int health;\n",
        "    int attackPower;\n",
        "}\n",

        "// These are objects - actual instances\n",
        "Monster goblin = new Monster();\n",
        "Monster dragon = new Monster();\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "You write the class once, but you can create as many objects from it as you need. One Monster class can spawn an entire dungeon full of monster objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Encapsulation: Protecting Your Data\n",
        "\n",
        "**Encapsulation** means bundling data and the methods that work on that data together in one unit (the class), while controlling access to that data from the outside world. It's like putting your valuable items in a locked chest - you decide who gets the key.\n",
        "\n",
        "Right now, with what you know about Java, anyone could do this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "Monster boss = new Monster();\n",
        "boss.health = -9999;  // Uh oh! Negative health makes no sense\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation lets us prevent this kind of problem by making our data **private** and providing controlled access through **public methods**:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "class Monster {\n",
        "    private int health;  // Now protected from direct access\n",
        "    \n",
        "    public void takeDamage(int damage) {\n",
        "        health = health - damage;\n",
        "        if (health < 0) {\n",
        "            health = 0;  // Can't go below zero\n",
        "        }\n",
        "    }\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The **private** keyword means only code inside the Monster class can directly access health. The **public** keyword means other code can call the takeDamage method. This way, we ensure health is always modified in a sensible way.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Abstraction: Hiding Complexity\n",
        "\n",
        "**Abstraction** means showing only the essential features while hiding the unnecessary details. When you use a vending machine, you don't need to know how it identifies coins or manages inventory - you just need to know how to insert money and press buttons.\n",
        "\n",
        "In programming, abstraction lets us use objects without understanding their internal complexity:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "// You can use a Monster without knowing HOW it calculates damage\n",
        "Monster orc = new Monster(\"Orc Warrior\", 50, 12);\n",
        "orc.attack(hero);  // Don't need to know the damage formula\n",
        "\n",
        "// The complex logic is hidden inside the class\n",
        "class Monster {\n",
        "    public void attack(Character target) {\n",
        "        // Complex damage calculation hidden here\n",
        "        int damage = calculateDamage(attackPower, target.getDefense());\n",
        "        target.takeDamage(damage);\n",
        "    }\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Users of your Monster class just need to know what methods are available (the **interface**), not how they work internally (the **implementation**).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Inheritance: Building on What Exists\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inheritance** allows us to create new classes based on existing ones, inheriting their attributes and methods while adding new features or modifying existing ones. It's like how a \"Fire Sword\" is still a sword, but with extra properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "// Base class\n",
        "class Item {\n",
        "    String name;\n",
        "    int value;\n",
        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "// Weapon inherits from Item\n",
        "class Weapon extends Item {\n",
        "    int damage;  // Weapons add a damage property\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The **extends** keyword creates an inheritance relationship. A Weapon has everything an Item has (name and value) plus its own special property (damage). We'll explore inheritance in detail in a later chapter, but it's important to know it exists as one of OOP's core pillars.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Polymorphism: Many Forms\n",
        "\n",
        "**Polymorphism** means \"many forms\" - the ability for the same method name to behave differently depending on the context. It's like how the command \"attack\" means different things for different character classes - a warrior swings a sword while a mage casts a spell.\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "class Warrior {\n",
        "    public void attack() {\n",
        "        System.out.println(\"Swings sword for physical damage!\");\n",
        "    }\n",
        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "class Mage {\n",
        "    public void attack() {\n",
        "        System.out.println(\"Casts fireball for magic damage!\");\n",
        "    }\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Both classes have an attack() method, but they do different things. This is a simple form of polymorphism. Like inheritance, we'll explore this more deeply later, but understanding that it exists helps you see the full picture of OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How the Pillars Work Together\n",
        "\n",
        "These four concepts don't work in isolation - they support each other:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Encapsulation** protects the integrity of objects\n",
        "- **Abstraction** makes objects easier to use\n",
        "- **Inheritance** lets us reuse and extend existing code\n",
        "- **Polymorphism** lets us write flexible, adaptable programs\n",
        "\n",
        "For now, we'll focus primarily on encapsulation and abstraction as we build our first classes. These are the foundations that make everything else possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Thinking Like an Object-Oriented Programmer\n",
        "\n",
        "To design object-oriented programs, ask yourself these questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **What are the \"things\" in my program?** These become your classes (Monster, Item, Character)\n",
        "2. **What does each thing need to know?** These become your attributes (health, name, damage)\n",
        "3. **What does each thing need to do?** These become your methods (attack, takeDamage, heal)\n",
        "4. **What should be hidden from other parts of the program?** This guides your encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "As you learn to think this way, you'll find that OOP mirrors how we naturally think about the world - as a collection of things with properties and behaviors, rather than as a long list of instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the next section, we'll put these ideas into practice by creating our first real class, complete with attributes and methods. You'll see how these abstract concepts translate into actual Java code you can run and experiment with."

        "\n",
        "A **class** in Java is defined using the `class` keyword, followed by the class name (which should start with a capital letter by convention). Inside the curly braces, we define **attributes** (also called **fields** or **instance variables**) and **methods**.\n",

        "### Methods: What Objects Can Do\n",

        "\n",
        "As you design your classes, keep these guidelines in mind:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Class names** should be nouns and start with a capital letter (Item, Monster, Character)\n",
        "2. **Method names** should be verbs or verb phrases and start with a lowercase letter (attack, takeDamage, isAlive)\n",
        "3. **Keep related things together** - a Monster's health and the methods that modify health belong in the Monster class\n",
        "4. **Methods should have a single, clear purpose** - don't create a method that both deals damage and adds experience points\n",
        "5. **Use meaningful names** - `getHealthPercentage()` is better than `calc()` or `hp()`\n",
        "\n",
        "### What's Missing?\n",
        "\n",
        "You might have noticed a problem with our classes - we can create Item and Monster objects, but we haven't set up a good way to give them initial values. Right now, all Items start with null names and 0 values. In the next section, we'll learn about constructors, which solve this problem elegantly.\n",
        "\n",
        "We also haven't protected our data yet. Anyone can still do `monster.health = -9999`, which breaks our game logic. We'll fix this with proper encapsulation using getters and setters.\n",
        "\n",
        "For now, understand that a class is a container for related attributes and methods. It defines what objects of that type know (attributes) and what they can do (methods). This is the foundation of object-oriented programming - organizing code into logical, self-contained units that model the things in your program."

        "### Creating Objects with new\n",
        "\n",
        "To create an object from a class, we use the **new** keyword. This process is called **instantiation** - we're creating an instance of the class.\n",

        "\n",
        "### The Default Constructor\n",
        "\n",
        "When you don't write any constructors, Java provides a **default constructor** that takes no parameters and does nothing special. It just creates the object with default values:\n",
        "- Numbers (int, double) are set to 0\n",
        "- Booleans are set to false  \n",
        "- Objects (including Strings) are set to null\n",

        "### Writing Your Own Constructor\n",
        "\n",
        "A **constructor** is a special method that runs when an object is created. It has the same name as the class and no return type (not even void). Let's add a constructor to our Item class:\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**Encapsulation**: All attributes are private with controlled access through getters and setters.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Constructor**: Every Item is born with a name, type, and value. We set quantity to 1 by default.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Getters**: Allow reading of all attributes safely.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Setters with Validation**: The setQuantity and setValue methods reject negative numbers, protecting our data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Behavior Methods**: Methods like `addQuantity()`, `getTotalValue()`, and `display()` make items do useful things.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The main Method**: This special `public static void main(String[] args)` method is where every Java program starts. It creates objects and demonstrates their behavior.\n",

        "\n",
        "Notice the design choices we made:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **name and type don't have setters** - An Iron Sword shouldn't suddenly become a Health Potion\n",
        "- **quantity can change** - You can find more items or use them up\n",
        "- **value can change** - Shops might offer discounts or items might get enchanted\n",
        "- **Validation prevents invalid states** - No negative quantities or values\n",
        "\n",
        "### Try It Yourself\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that you have a working program, try modifying it:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Add a new item to the inventory\n",
        "2. Create a method `use()` that decreases quantity by 1\n",
        "3. Add a weight attribute with appropriate getter/setter\n",
        "4. Create a method `canAfford(int gold)` that returns true if you have enough gold to buy the item\n",
        "\n",
        "Each change will help you understand how classes, objects, and encapsulation work together.\n",
        "\n",

        "Compare this to how you might have written it procedurally with parallel arrays:\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "With OOP, each Item is a self-contained unit that manages its own data and behavior. The code is more organized, safer (thanks to encapsulation), and easier to extend.\n",

        "4. **Setters** for health only (the other attributes shouldn't change after creation)\n",

        "   - `display()` - Prints the monster's current status\n",

        "6. **A main method** that:\n",
        "   - Creates at least 3 monsters (including one boss)\n",
        "   - Demonstrates the monsters taking damage and healing\n",
        "   - Shows a simple battle between two monsters\n",

        "\n",
        "If you get stuck, here are some hints:\n",

        "```java\n",
        "this.health = maxHealth;\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hint 2 - Boss Double Damage**: In the attack() method, check if it's a boss:\n",
        "```java\n",
        "if (isBoss) {\n",
        "    return attackPower * 2;\n",
        "} else {\n",
        "    return attackPower;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hint 3 - Preventing Invalid Health**: In takeDamage, check for negative:\n",
        "```java\n",
        "health = health - damage;\n",
        "if (health < 0) {\n",
        "    health = 0;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hint 4 - Battle Logic**: In main, you can simulate a simple battle:\n",
        "```java\n",
        "System.out.println(\"Goblin attacks Orc!\");\n",
        "orc.takeDamage(goblin.attack());\n",
        "orc.display();\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Testing Your Solution\n",
        "\n",
        "Your program should:\n",
        "1. Compile without errors\n",
        "2. Properly encapsulate all data (private attributes, public methods)\n",
        "3. Prevent invalid states (no negative health, no healing above max)\n",
        "4. Show bosses doing double damage\n",
        "5. Correctly track whether monsters are alive\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "If you finish early, try adding these features:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Defense attribute**: Reduce incoming damage by the defense amount\n",
        "2. **Experience points**: Monsters give XP when defeated (bosses give more)\n",
        "3. **Critical hits**: 10% chance to do double damage on any attack\n",
        "4. **Multiple attacks**: Let monsters attack multiple times based on their speed\n",
        "\n",
        "### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Forgetting `private`**: Make sure all attributes are private\n",
        "- **Missing validation**: Check boundaries in takeDamage and heal\n",
        "- **Wrong setter logic**: The setHealth should also validate\n",
        "- **Not using the constructor properly**: Set all attributes in the constructor\n",
        "- **Forgetting to check isAlive**: Dead monsters shouldn't be able to attack\n",
        "\n",
        "### How You'll Know You Succeeded\n",
        "\n",
        "You've successfully completed this problem when:\n",
        "- Your code compiles and runs\n",
        "- All data is properly encapsulated\n",
        "- Monsters can't have invalid health values\n",
        "- Bosses correctly do double damage\n",
        "- Your main method demonstrates all the monster's abilities\n",

        "Sometimes you want to create objects in different ways. Maybe you know all the details, or maybe you only know some and want defaults for the rest. **Constructor overloading** lets you provide multiple ways to create objects from the same class.\n",

        "- [ ] Using toString() to display spell status\n",
        "- [ ] Comparing spells with equals()\n",
        "- [ ] Different caster power levels affecting damage\n",
        "\n",
        "### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Forgetting to check isReady()** in the cast method\n",
        "- **Not preventing negative cooldown** in reduceCooldown\n",
        "- **Setting currentCooldown in constructor** (should start at 0)\n",
        "- **Using == for String comparison** in equals\n",
        "- **Not handling the Object parameter** correctly in equals\n",
        "\n",
        "### Bonus Challenges\n",
        "\n",
        "If you finish early, try adding:\n",
        "1. A `manaCostModifier` that reduces mana cost for experienced casters\n",
        "2. A `criticalHit()` method with a 10% chance to double damage\n",
        "3. An `ArrayList<String> elements` to track spell types (fire, ice, etc.)\n",
        "4. A method to compare spell efficiency (damage per mana)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why This Problem Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "This Spell class demonstrates:\n",
        "- **Encapsulation**: Private data with public methods\n",
        "- **State management**: Tracking and updating cooldowns\n",
        "- **Validation**: Checking if spells can be cast\n",
        "- **Overloaded constructors**: Providing flexibility\n",
        "- **Object methods**: toString() and equals()\n",
        "- **Calculated values**: Damage based on caster power\n",
        "- **Complete program**: Main method that tests everything\n",
        "\n",
        "### Success Criteria\n",
        "\n",
        "You've succeeded when:\n",
        "- Your code compiles and runs without errors\n",
        "- Spells correctly manage their cooldown state\n",
        "- The cast method properly checks availability and calculates damage\n",
        "- Your toString() shows different messages based on state\n",
        "- Your equals() method correctly compares spells\n",
        "- Your main method demonstrates all features clearly\n",
        "\n",
        "This is your opportunity to show you can build a complete, functional class from scratch. Take your time, test each method as you write it, and make sure your output clearly shows each feature working.\n",
