        "In Chapter 7, you mastered the art of creating individual classes - building Character objects for your D&D adventures with constructors, encapsulation, and special methods. You learned to manage single heroes and organize them into adventuring parties. But what happens when you need to create dozens of related classes that share common traits? Imagine running a corner store with hundreds of different products: snacks, beverages, magazines, and toiletries. Writing completely separate classes for each type would mean copying the same code over and over again. There's a better way: **inheritance** - a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming that lets classes share and extend functionality from other classes.\n",

The owner, Mr. Kim, needs to track hundreds of different products. As you start coding, you quickly discover that many products share common properties - every item has a name, price, and barcode. But you also need to track unique details: beverages have volume, snacks have calories, magazines have publishers. How do you organize this without writing the same code over and over? This is where inheritance becomes essential.\n",

        "### Starting Without Inheritance: The Copy-Paste Trap\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's say you start by creating a class for soda products. It seems straightforward enough:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public class Soda {\n",
        "    private String name;\n",
        "    private double price;\n",
        "    private String barcode;\n",

        "    private String name;      // Copied from Soda\n",

        "### Understanding Relationships: The \"IS-A\" Test\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we can use inheritance, we need to identify which classes share a relationship. In programming, we use the **\"IS-A\" test** to determine if inheritance makes sense. Ask yourself: \"Is X a type of Y?\"\n",

        "- A Soda IS-A Beverage? ✓ Yes\n",

        "- A Magazine IS-A Beverage? ✗ No! (This would be wrong)\n",

        "When the IS-A relationship is true, the first item can **inherit** from the second. This natural relationship guides how we structure our code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Introducing the extends Keyword\n",
        "\n",
        "Java uses the **extends** keyword to create inheritance relationships. When one class extends another, it automatically receives all the parent's (non-private) fields and methods. Here's the basic syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public class Child extends Parent {\n",
        "    // Child automatically has everything Parent has\n",
        "    // Plus whatever new things we add here\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The class after `extends` is called the **parent class**, **superclass**, or **base class**. The class doing the extending is called the **child class**, **subclass**, or **derived class**. These terms are interchangeable, but we'll primarily use parent/child for clarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Your First Inheritance Example\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's see how extends works with a minimal example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "// Parent class\n",
        "public class StoreItem {\n",
        "    protected String name;\n",
        "    protected double price;\n",
        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "// Child class  \n",
        "public class Beverage extends StoreItem {\n",
        "    // Beverage automatically has name and price from StoreItem\n",
        "    private int volumeML;  // Plus this new field\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "That's it! The Beverage class now has three fields: `name` and `price` (inherited from StoreItem) plus `volumeML` (its own addition). No copying required.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The protected Access Modifier\n",
        "\n",
        "Notice we used **protected** instead of private for the parent's fields. This is a new access level between private and public:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Modifier | Who Can Access | When to Use |\n",
        "|----------|---------------|-------------|\n",
        "| private | Only this class | Hide implementation details |\n",
        "| **protected** | This class + child classes | Share with family |\n",
        "| public | Everyone | Public interface |\n",
        "\n",
        "Protected members are specifically designed for inheritance - they let child classes access parent fields while still hiding them from unrelated classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Introducing the super Keyword\n",
        "\n",
        "When a child class needs to refer to its parent, it uses the **super** keyword. The most common use is calling the parent's constructor:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public class Beverage extends StoreItem {\n",
        "    private int volumeML;\n",
        "    \n",
        "    public Beverage(String n, double p, int v) {\n",
        "        super(n, p);  // Calls StoreItem's constructor\n",
        "        volumeML = v;  // Sets Beverage's own field\n",
        "    }\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The `super()` call says \"run my parent's constructor first.\" This ensures the parent portion of the object is properly initialized before the child adds its own setup. We'll explore this more in the next sections.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Gets Inherited?\n",
        "\n",
        "When a class extends another, here's what the child receives:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Child DOES inherit:**\n",
        "- All public methods from parent\n",
        "- All protected methods from parent\n",

Now let's explore the full power of child classes - how they can add multiple fields, create specialized methods, and even have their own children.

Let's build these specialized classes that make our inventory system truly useful.\n",

        "3. **Don't fight the parent**: If you're constantly working around inherited features, reconsider the design\n",
        "4. **Initialize properly**: Always call super() with appropriate values\n",

        "**Polymorphism** (from Greek meaning \"many forms\") is perhaps the most powerful feature of object-oriented programming. It allows a single variable to refer to objects of different types, as long as they share a parent class. Think of it like a store's cash register - it can ring up any item in the store (beverages, snacks, magazines) because they're all StoreItems. The register doesn't need to know the specific type; it just knows they can all be sold. This is polymorphism in action.\n",

        "### Parent References Can Hold Child Objects\n",

        "\n",

        "### Abstract Classes Can Mix Abstract and Concrete\n",
        "\n",

        "### When to Make a Class Abstract\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",

        "### The Template Method Pattern\n",
        "\n",
        "One powerful use of abstract classes is the **template method pattern** - defining the skeleton of an algorithm while letting subclasses customize specific steps:\n",

        "\n",
        "Abstract classes are perfect when you need to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Share code among related classes**: Common functionality in parent, specifics in children\n",

        "4. **Create frameworks**: Define the structure, let users fill in details\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstract classes strike a balance between providing implementation and requiring customization. They're more flexible than regular classes (which provide everything) but more structured than interfaces (which we'll learn about later). Use them when you have a genuine \"is-a\" relationship but the parent is too general to instantiate on its own."

This is like how a can of Coke is simultaneously a Soda, a Beverage, and a StoreItem. Understanding how references work with inheritance is crucial for mastering polymorphism and avoiding common pitfalls.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Reference Type vs Object Type\n",
        "\n",

        "- **Object type**: The actual type created with new (right side of =)\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "StoreItem item = new Beverage(\"Juice\", 3.99, 500);\n",
        "//   ↑                    ↑\n",
        "// Reference type    Object type\n",

        "\n",
        "Think of it like a name tag at a conference. The tag might say \"Speaker\" (reference type), but the person is actually a \"Software Engineer\" (object type). The tag limits how others interact with them, but doesn't change who they really are.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Upcasting: Automatic and Safe\n",
        "\n",
        "**Upcasting** is storing a child object in a parent reference. It's called \"up\" because you're going up the inheritance tree. Java does this automatically because it's always safe - every child IS-A parent:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "Beverage coke = new Beverage(\"Coke\", 2.99, 355);\n",

        "\n",

        "**Use Shallow Copy when:**\n",
        "- Objects won't be modified\n",
        "- Sharing data is intentional\n",
        "- Working with immutable objects (like Strings)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Use Deep Copy when:**\n",
        "- Objects will be modified\n",
        "- You need independent copies\n",
        "- Creating backups or history\n",

        "### Key Takeaway\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of copying like making backup inventory sheets:\n",
        "- **Shallow copy**: Photocopying the sheet (both sheets refer to the same actual items)\n",
        "- **Deep copy**: Creating a completely new inventory with duplicate items\n",
        "\n",
        "Most of the time in beginner programs, you'll use shallow copying (or just share references). Deep copying becomes important when you need truly independent objects, especially for things like game save states, undo operations, or backup systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember: assignment (=) never copies objects in Java, it only copies references. To get a real copy, you need to explicitly create one using a copy constructor or copy method!"
