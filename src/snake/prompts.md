# Snake Game — AI Prompts

## Prompt 1 — Project setup

> I'm starting a Java game project in VS Code using Swing. Create a single file called `SnakeGame.java` with a `main` method that opens a `JFrame` window (600x600 pixels) titled "Snake". Add a `JPanel` subclass called `GamePanel` inside the frame. No game logic yet — just get the window to open.

## Prompt 2 — Grid and snake

> Add a 20x20 grid to `GamePanel`. Represent the snake as a sequence of grid cells and start it with 3 segments near the center, facing right. Each cell should be drawn as a 30x30 pixel square. Draw the snake in green and the background in dark gray.

## Prompt 3 — Game loop, movement, and keyboard input

> Make the snake move automatically using a Swing timer that ticks every 150 milliseconds — the snake should advance one cell per tick in its current direction. Add arrow key controls so the player can steer, but don't allow the snake to reverse direction. For now, have the snake wrap around the edges instead of dying. Make sure the panel can receive keyboard input.

## Prompt 4 — Food, collision, score, and restart

> Add a food pellet that spawns at a random empty cell. When the snake eats it, grow by one segment and spawn new food. Add collision detection: hitting a wall or the snake's own body should end the game, stop movement, and show a "Game Over" message with the final score in the center of the screen. Display the current score in the top-left corner during play. When the game is over, let the player press R to reset everything and play again.
