        "\n",
        "**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming **paradigm**---a model or philosophy for writing software programs. It's based on the idea of breaking down software into smaller pieces, known as **objects**, which represent real-world or conceptual entities. Each object can hold data **(attributes)** and **methods**. Data refers to the attributes or properties of an object, essentially what an object has. Methods are the actions or behaviors an object can perform, essentially what an object does.\n",
        "\n",
        "In OOP, programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. This approach is inspired by how things work in the real world, making it easier for programmers to think about and manage their code. The two basic concepts of OOP--from which everything else follows--are these:\n",
        "-   A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. A class defines the data and methods that its objects will contain.\n",
        "-   An **Object** is an instance of a class. If a class is like a blueprint, an object is like a house built from that blueprint. Each object has its own set of data and methods, according to the class definition."

        "- **Methods** are blocks of code that define the behaviors of the objects. A method in Java is created by specifying a return type (the type of value the method sends back to its caller), the method's name, and a pair of parentheses `()`. If the method takes parameters, you list them inside these parentheses.\n",
        "- A **constructor** is a special method that has the same name as the class. It is called whenever new objects are created from the class.\n",

        "The HotelTransylvania1 class is a simple Java application that shows how to create and manipulate objects. It's designed to simulate a basic system for managing guests in a hotel, specifically tailored to the whimsical and spooky guests of the fictional Hotel Transylvania. Some things of importance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The `main` method serves as the entry point for any standalone Java application. When you run a Java program, the execution starts from the `main` method.\n",
        " -   It's declared as `public static void main(String[] args)`. The `public` modifier means it can be called from any other class, `static` allows it to be invoked without creating an instance of its class, `void` means it doesn't return any value, and `String[] args` is an array of strings that stores command-line arguments.\n",
        "2. In the `main` method, we create instances (objects) of the `Guest` class using the `new` keyword. This process is known as object instantiation. Each object represents a different guest at the hotel with unique attributes like name, age, species, and special requirements.\n",
        " -   For example, `Guest dracula = new Guest(\"Count Dracula\", 537, \"Vampire\", \"Blackout curtains for daytime sleep\");` This line creates a new `Guest` object named `dracula` with the provided attributes.\n",
        "3. After creating objects, you can call methods on these objects to perform actions or access their data. In this class, we assume a `displayGuestInfo()` method exists within the `Guest` class, which prints out the guest's details.\n",
        " -   `dracula.displayGuestInfo();` This line calls the `displayGuestInfo()` method on the `dracula` object, which should display Dracula's information.\n",
        "4. Getter and setter methods are commonly used to access and modify the private attributes of a class.\n",
        " -   A method call like `werewolf.getName()` allows external access to a guest's name in a controlled manner.\n",
        " -   Similarly, a method like `frankenstein.setName(\"Frank\")` allows the name of a guest to be changed after the object has been created.\n",
        "\n",
        " And with this, we've created our first multi-class Java application! Of course, most \"real-world\" Java applications contain *many* classes."
