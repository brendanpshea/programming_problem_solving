        "\n",
        "**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming **paradigm**---a model or philosophy for writing software programs. It's based on the idea of breaking down software into smaller pieces, known as **objects**, which represent real-world or conceptual entities. Each object can hold data **(attributes)** and **methods**. Data refers to the attributes or properties of an object, essentially what an object has. Methods are the actions or behaviors an object can perform, essentially what an object does.\n",
        "\n",
        "In OOP, programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. This approach is inspired by how things work in the real world, making it easier for programmers to think about and manage their code. The two basic concepts of OOP--from which everything else follows--are these:\n",
        "-   A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. A class defines the data and methods that its objects will contain.\n",
        "-   An **Object** is an instance of a class. If a class is like a blueprint, an object is like a house built from that blueprint. Each object has its own set of data and methods, according to the class definition."

        "- **Methods** are blocks of code that define the behaviors of the objects. A method in Java is created by specifying a return type (the type of value the method sends back to its caller), the method's name, and a pair of parentheses `()`. If the method takes parameters, you list them inside these parentheses.\n",
        "- A **constructor** is a special method that has the same name as the class. It is called whenever new objects are created from the class.\n",

        "The GuestTest class is a simple Java application that shows how to create and manipulate objects. It's designed to simulate a basic system for managing guests in a hotel, specifically tailored to the whimsical and spooky guests of the fictional Hotel Transylvania. Some things of importance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The `main` method serves as the entry point for any standalone Java application. When you run a Java program, the execution starts from the `main` method.\n",
        " -   It's declared as `public static void main(String[] args)`. The `public` modifier means it can be called from any other class, `static` allows it to be invoked without creating an instance of its class, `void` means it doesn't return any value, and `String[] args` is an array of strings that stores command-line arguments.\n",
        "2. In the `main` method, we create instances (objects) of the `Guest` class using the `new` keyword. This process is known as object instantiation. Each object represents a different guest at the hotel with unique attributes like name, age, species, and special requirements.\n",
        " -   For example, `Guest dracula = new Guest(\"Count Dracula\", 537, \"Vampire\", \"Blackout curtains for daytime sleep\");` This line creates a new `Guest` object named `dracula` with the provided attributes.\n",
        "3. After creating objects, you can call methods on these objects to perform actions or access their data. In this class, we assume a `displayGuestInfo()` method exists within the `Guest` class, which prints out the guest's details.\n",
        " -   `dracula.displayGuestInfo();` This line calls the `displayGuestInfo()` method on the `dracula` object, which should display Dracula's information.\n",
        "4. Getter and setter methods are commonly used to access and modify the private attributes of a class.\n",
        " -   A method call like `werewolf.getName()` allows external access to a guest's name in a controlled manner.\n",
        " -   Similarly, a method like `frankenstein.setName(\"Frank\")` allows the name of a guest to be changed after the object has been created.\n",
        "\n",
        " And with this, we've created our first multi-class Java application! Of course, most \"real-world\" Java applications contain *many* classes. In the next section of this chapter, we'll start exploring how this works."

        "### Why Didn't My Java Program Run?\n",
        "\n",
        "When working with Java, especially for beginners, running into issues where your program won't run as expected is common. Let's explore some typical problems you might face when working with a `Guest` class and its corresponding test class, `GuestTest`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1\\. Class Name and File Name Mismatch.** The name of the public class must exactly match the name of the file it is in, considering Java's case sensitivity. For example, If your public class is named `Guest`, the file name must be `Guest.java`. Similarly, for `GuestTest`, the file name should be `GuestTest.java`. Any deviation, including differences in capitalization, will prevent your Java program from compiling correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2\\. Incorrect Directory Placement.**  Java doesn't require a specific directory structure if you're not using packages, but your source files (`Guest.java` and `GuestTest.java`) need to be in the directory where you compile and run them, or you need to specify their location if compiling from a different directory. For example, of you're compiling from the directory above your source code, you need to specify the path to the `.java` files, like `javac myproject/Guest.java myproject/GuestTest.java`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3\\. Compilation Errors.** Java requires that you compile your source code into bytecode (`Guest.class` and `GuestTest.class`) before you can run it. Compilation issues can arise from syntax errors or missing dependencies. For example, if `GuestTest` depends on `Guest` (e.g., it creates a `Guest` object), you must compile `Guest.java` before `GuestTest.java`. Otherwise, you'll encounter compilation errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4\\. Incorrect Execution Command or Sequence.**  After compiling, you run your program with the `java` command followed by the class name without the `.class` extension. Ensure you've compiled all necessary classes first. For example, to run `GuestTest`, ensure both `Guest` and `GuestTest` are compiled. Then execute `java GuestTest` in the command line. Running the class without compiling it or using the wrong class name for execution will result in errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5\\. Dependencies and Typographical Errors.**  If your classes depend on each other or external libraries, ensure all dependencies are resolved and available at compile time. Additionally, Java's case sensitivity means typographical errors can prevent your program from running. For example, if `GuestTest` uses methods from `Guest`, any typo in method names or incorrect method calls (e.g., using `Getname` instead of `getName` if it's defined as such in `Guest`) will cause compile-time errors."

        "Now that we understand the basic idea of classes and objects, let's try our hand at creating another class. The Room class will represent a hotel room, encapsulating properties such as room number, type, occupancy status, and nightly rate. Here's how we conceptualize this class:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Attributes define the characteristics of a room.\n",
        "    -   `roomNumber` is an integer representing the room's unique identifier.\n",
        "    -   `type` is a String that could represent the type of room (e.g., \"Single\", \"Double\", \"Suite\").\n",
        "    -   `guest`is a `Guest` object indicating the current occupant of the room. This replaces the `isOccupied` boolean.\n",
        "    -   `nightlyRate` is a double-length floating point number representing the cost per night to stay in the room.\n",
        "2.  The constructor initializes a new instance of the Room class.\n",
        "     -   The constructor takes parameters for room number, type, and nightly rate.\n",
        "     - The `guest` attribute is initialized to `null` to indicate that the room is initially unoccupied. In Java, `null` means \"nothing.\" (This is the same a `NULL` in SQL or `None` in Python).\n",
        "3.  The methods define the behavior of a room.\n",
        "    -   `assignGuest(Guest guest)`assigns a guest to the room.\n",
        "    -   `vacateRoom()` removes the guest from the room, setting the `guest` attribute back to `null`.\n",
        "    -   `displayRoomDetails()` prints out the room's details, including room number, type, occupancy status (based on whether a guest is present), and nightly rate.\n",

        "\n",
        "Creating and using classes and objects are fundamental in Java programming. These steps will guide you through the process of class declaration, creating constructors, defining getter and setter methods, and finally, how to use these classes in a client program.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 1: Declare Your Class\n",
        "A class in Java is a blueprint from which individual objects are created. It contains fields (variables) and methods to define the object's behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public class Book {\n",
        "    // Fields, Constructor, Methods will go here\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 2: Add Fields to Your Class\n",
        "Fields (or attributes) are variables that provide the state of an object. Each object created from the class can have its own values for these fields.\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public class Book {\n",
        "    private String title;\n",
        "    private String author;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 3: Create a Constructor\n",
        "\n",
        "A constructor in Java is a special method used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public class Book {\n",
        "    // Fields\n",

        "    }\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 4: Define Getter and Setter Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "These methods allow you to get and set the value of a field. The getter method returns the variable value, and the setter method sets the value.\n",

        "    // Fields, Constructor\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Step 5: Write a Client Program to Use Your Class\n",
        "This is a separate Java class that uses your `Book` class to create objects and access them using the getter and setter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public class BookTest {\n",
        "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
        "        // Creating an object of class Book\n",
        "        Book myBook = new Book(\"Dracula\", \"Bram Stoker\");\n",

        "        // Accessing object data through getter methods\n",
        "        System.out.println(\"Title: \" + myBook.getTitle());\n",
        "        System.out.println(\"Author: \" + myBook.getAuthor());\n",
        "\n",
        "        // Modifying object data through setter methods\n",
        "        myBook.setTitle(\"Dracula, Revised Edition\");\n",
        "        System.out.println(\"Updated Title: \" + myBook.getTitle());\n",
        "    }\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, we first create a `Book` class with two fields (`title` and `author`), a constructor to initialize these fields, and getter and setter methods for both fields. Then, in the client program (the `Main` class), we create a `Book` object named `myBook` and use its constructor to set the title and author. We access the book's title and author using the getter methods and print them. Finally, we change the book's title using the setter method and print the updated title."
