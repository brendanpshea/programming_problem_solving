        "# What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming **paradigm**---a model or philosophy for writing software programs. It's based on the idea of breaking down software into smaller pieces, known as **objects**, which represent real-world or conceptual entities. Each object can hold data **(attributes)** and **methods**. Data refers to the attributes or properties of an object, essentially what an object has. Methods are the actions or behaviors an object can perform, essentially what an object does.\n",
        "\n",
        "In OOP, programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. This approach is inspired by how things work in the real world, making it easier for programmers to think about and manage their code. The two basic concepts of OOP--from which everything else follows--are these:\n",
        "-   A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. A class defines the data and methods that its objects will contain.\n",
        "-   An **Object** is an instance of a class. If a class is like a blueprint, an object is like a house built from that blueprint. Each object has its own set of data and methods, according to the class definition."

Second, you create objects from this class, which are instances embodying the defined attributes and methods.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Attributes** are variables that hold data about the state of an object. They are defined by specifying a data type and a name for the variable.\n",
        "- **Methods** are blocks of code that define the behaviors of the objects. A method in Java is created by specifying a return type (the type of value the method sends back to its caller), the method's name, and a pair of parentheses `()`. If the method takes parameters, you list them inside these parentheses.\n",
        "- A **constructor** is a special method that has the same name as the class. It is called whenever new objects are created from the class.\n",
        "- Every Java program (though not necessarily every Java class) must have a **main** method. This is the method that gets called when the program is \"run.\"\n",
