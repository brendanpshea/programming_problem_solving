        "# Welcome to Graphical User Interfaces\n",
        "**Brendan Shea, PhD**\n",
        "\n",
        "So far in your Java journey, you've built programs that run in the terminal—programs that print text, ask for input via `Scanner`, and produce output line by line. These **command-line interfaces** (CLIs) are powerful and efficient, but they're not how most modern software works. When you open your web browser, play a game, or use a messaging app, you're interacting with a **graphical user interface** (GUI, pronounced \"gooey\"). In this chapter, we'll learn how to build desktop applications with windows, buttons, text fields, and all the visual elements users expect.\n",
        "\n",
        "### CLI vs. GUI: A Different Way of Thinking\n",
        "\n",
        "**Command-line interfaces** operate sequentially: your program runs from top to bottom, pausing when it needs input. The user types a response, hits Enter, and the program continues. This works well for scripts and tools, but it's limiting—users can only interact in the order you've prescribed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Graphical user interfaces** are fundamentally different. Instead of a linear flow, GUI programs are **event-driven**: they create a window with various components (buttons, text fields, menus), then wait for the user to do something. When the user clicks a button or types in a field, an **event** is triggered, and your code responds. The user is in control of what happens and when.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Java's GUI Toolkit Landscape\n",
        "\n",
        "Java has offered several frameworks for building GUIs over the years:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)**: Java's original GUI library, released in 1995. It uses native operating system components, which means buttons look different on Windows vs. Mac. Still used as a foundation, but limited.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Swing**: Built on top of AWT in 1997, Swing provides richer, more consistent components that look the same across all platforms. It's mature, well-documented, and perfect for desktop applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **JavaFX**: A more modern framework (2008) with better styling, multimedia support, and visual effects. It's powerful but adds complexity we don't need yet.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Android SDK**: Google's framework for mobile apps. Uses a different component model entirely, though the event-driven concepts transfer.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why Swing?** For self-contained desktop programs that students can run locally, Swing offers the best balance: it's stable, widely supported, requires no extra setup, and teaches core GUI concepts that apply to any framework. Once you understand Swing, learning JavaFX or Android becomes much easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Event-Driven Mindset\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the key conceptual shift you need to make: in CLI programs, *you* control the flow of execution. In GUI programs, *the user* controls the flow through their actions. Your job is to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Set up the interface**: Create the window and add visual components\n",
        "2. **Register listeners**: Tell Java what to do when events occur (clicks, key presses, etc.)\n",
        "3. **Let the event loop run**: Java's GUI framework watches for user actions and calls your code when needed\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it like this: you're not writing a script that executes step-by-step. You're setting up a stage with props (buttons, text fields) and writing handlers that respond when actors (users) interact with those props. This is the essence of **event-driven programming**.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Next up:** Let's dive in and create our very first window. You'll see just how easy it is to get a GUI program up and running—and from there, we'll add components, handle events, and build increasingly sophisticated applications."

Windows need to appear on *your* screen, and you need to interact with them using *your* mouse and keyboard. That means it's time to set up a local Java development environment.\n",

        "\n",
        "GUI applications create visual windows that require a display. Cloud environments don't have access to your monitor, so they can't show windows to you. Additionally, GUI programs are interactive—they respond to mouse clicks, keyboard input, and window events in real-time. This all needs to happen on your local machine.\n",

        "3. Launch BlueJ\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Writing and Running Your First GUI Program\n",
        "1. **Create a new project**: Click \"Project\" → \"New Project\", give it a name (e.g., `My First GUIs`), and choose a location\n",
        "2. **Create a new class**: Click \"New Class\", name it (e.g., `HelloWindow`), and click \"OK\". You'll be creating a number of different classes in this lesson.\n",
        "3. **Write your code**: Double-click the class to open the editor and type your Java code\n",
        "4. **Compile**: Click the \"Compile\" button at the top of the editor window\n",
        "5. **Run**: Right-click the class icon in the main window, select the main method from the menu, and click \"OK\"\n",

        "In the last section, we discovered a problem: adding multiple components to a frame caused some to disappear. This happened because we didn't specify *how* to arrange them. In Swing, **layout managers** handle the positioning and sizing of components automatically. Instead of specifying exact pixel coordinates (which would break on different screen sizes), you tell a layout manager the rules, and it arranges everything intelligently.\n",

        "\n",

        "### FlowLayout: Simple Left-to-Right Arrangement\n",
        "\n",
        "**FlowLayout** is the simplest layout manager. It arranges components in a row, left to right, like words in a paragraph. When a row fills up, it wraps to the next line. This works great for simple interfaces with a few buttons or small components.\n",

Your job is to write code that responds to these events. You do this by registering a **listener**—an object that \"listens\" for specific events and runs code when they occur.\n",

        "3. **Registration**: You tell the component about your listener using `addActionListener()`\n",

        "5. Update `lastClickTime` to `currentTime` for the next click\n",

        "As your GUI applications grow larger, you'll notice a problem: all your code gets tangled together. Game logic mixes with button creation, data management lives alongside layout code, and changing one thing breaks another. This is where **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** comes in—a design pattern that organizes your code into three distinct parts, making it easier to understand, modify, and debug.\n",

        "- Validates user input (game logic)\n",
        "- Updates the target number (data management)\n",
        "- Changes label text (GUI updates)\n",
