        "# Welcome to Graphical User Interfaces\n",
        "\n",
        "So far in your Java journey, you've built programs that run in the terminal—programs that print text, ask for input via `Scanner`, and produce output line by line. These **command-line interfaces** (CLIs) are powerful and efficient, but they're not how most modern software works. When you open your web browser, play a game, or use a messaging app, you're interacting with a **graphical user interface** (GUI, pronounced \"gooey\"). In this chapter, we'll learn how to build desktop applications with windows, buttons, text fields, and all the visual elements users expect.\n",
        "\n",
        "## CLI vs. GUI: A Different Way of Thinking\n",
        "\n",
        "**Command-line interfaces** operate sequentially: your program runs from top to bottom, pausing when it needs input. The user types a response, hits Enter, and the program continues. This works well for scripts and tools, but it's limiting—users can only interact in the order you've prescribed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Graphical user interfaces** are fundamentally different. Instead of a linear flow, GUI programs are **event-driven**: they create a window with various components (buttons, text fields, menus), then wait for the user to do something. When the user clicks a button or types in a field, an **event** is triggered, and your code responds. The user is in control of what happens and when.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Java's GUI Toolkit Landscape\n",
        "\n",
        "Java has offered several frameworks for building GUIs over the years:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)**: Java's original GUI library, released in 1995. It uses native operating system components, which means buttons look different on Windows vs. Mac. Still used as a foundation, but limited.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Swing**: Built on top of AWT in 1997, Swing provides richer, more consistent components that look the same across all platforms. It's mature, well-documented, and perfect for desktop applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **JavaFX**: A more modern framework (2008) with better styling, multimedia support, and visual effects. It's powerful but adds complexity we don't need yet.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Android SDK**: Google's framework for mobile apps. Uses a different component model entirely, though the event-driven concepts transfer.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why Swing?** For self-contained desktop programs that students can run locally, Swing offers the best balance: it's stable, widely supported, requires no extra setup, and teaches core GUI concepts that apply to any framework. Once you understand Swing, learning JavaFX or Android becomes much easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Event-Driven Mindset\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the key conceptual shift you need to make: in CLI programs, *you* control the flow of execution. In GUI programs, *the user* controls the flow through their actions. Your job is to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Set up the interface**: Create the window and add visual components\n",
        "2. **Register listeners**: Tell Java what to do when events occur (clicks, key presses, etc.)\n",
        "3. **Let the event loop run**: Java's GUI framework watches for user actions and calls your code when needed\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it like this: you're not writing a script that executes step-by-step. You're setting up a stage with props (buttons, text fields) and writing handlers that respond when actors (users) interact with those props. This is the essence of **event-driven programming**.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Next up:** Let's dive in and create our very first window. You'll see just how easy it is to get a GUI program up and running—and from there, we'll add components, handle events, and build increasingly sophisticated applications."

        "The `jar cfe` command creates a JAR file: `c` means create, `f` specifies the filename, and `e` sets the entry point (main class).\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you've downloaded the JAR to your computer, double-clicking it should launch the program, or you can run it from your terminal with `java -jar`. (If this doesn't work, you need to install Java first! You can search \"install Java\" for how to do this).\n",

        "When you run this program, a 400×300 pixel window titled \"My First GUI Window\" appears on your screen. It's empty—no buttons, no text—but it's a real, functioning GUI window that you can move, resize, minimize, and close.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key observations:**\n",
        "- The program doesn't end after creating the window. Instead, it enters Swing's event loop, waiting for user actions.\n",
        "- The window appears wherever your operating system decides to place it (usually cascading from the top-left).\n",
        "- You can interact with it like any other application window—drag it around, resize it, and click the close button to exit.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Common mistake:** Forgetting `setVisible(true)`. Your window exists in memory but remains invisible until you explicitly show it. Always remember this final step!\n",

        "Unlike your CLI programs that print output and exit, this program:\n",
        "1. Creates the GUI components (the frame)\n",
        "2. Configures their properties\n",
        "3. Makes them visible\n",
        "4. Then Java's event dispatch thread takes over, keeping the window alive and responsive\n",
        "\n",
        "The `main` method completes almost immediately, but the program continues running because the event loop is active. This is event-driven programming in action."
