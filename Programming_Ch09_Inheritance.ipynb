        "# Inheritance and Polymorphism\n",
        "In this chapter, we will learn about **inheritance** and **polymorphism**, two important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java. Inheritance allows us to create new classes that are based on existing classes, inheriting their properties and methods. Polymorphism allows us to use objects of different classes interchangeably, as if they were objects of a common superclass. These concepts help us to create more modular, flexible, and reusable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this chapter, we will be using a case study to illustrate the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism. We will be building software to manage a humane society, an organization that cares for animals and helps them find homes. The software will need to keep track of information about the animals, such as their breed, age, and medical history, as well as information about the people who adopt them. We will design classes to represent animals, people, and other entities involved in the humane society, and we will use inheritance and polymorphism to organize these classes and enable code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, we might have a class called Animal that represents all animals at the humane society. This class could have attributes such as name, breed, and age, and shared methods such as `getWeight()` and `setAage()`. We could then create subclasses of Animal to represent specific types of animals, such as Dog and Cat. These subclasses could inherit the properties and methods of the Animal class, but they could also have additional properties and methods that are specific to their type.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using inheritance and polymorphism, we can create a hierarchy of classes that represents the relationships between different entities in the humane society, and we can write code that is more modular, flexible, and reusable."
