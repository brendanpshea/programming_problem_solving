        "# Inheritance and Polymorphism\n",
        "In this chapter, we will learn about **inheritance** and **polymorphism**, two important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java. Inheritance allows us to create new classes that are based on existing classes, inheriting their properties and methods. Polymorphism allows us to use objects of different classes interchangeably, as if they were objects of a common superclass. These concepts help us to create more modular, flexible, and reusable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this chapter, we will be using a case study to illustrate the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism. We will be building software to manage a humane society, an organization that cares for animals and helps them find homes. The software will need to keep track of information about the animals, such as their breed, age, and medical history, as well as information about the people who adopt them. We will design classes to represent animals, people, and other entities involved in the humane society, and we will use inheritance and polymorphism to organize these classes and enable code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, we might have a class called Animal that represents all animals at the humane society. This class could have attributes such as name, breed, and age, and shared methods such as `getWeight()` and `setAage()`. We could then create subclasses of Animal to represent specific types of animals, such as Dog and Cat. These subclasses could inherit the properties and methods of the Animal class, but they could also have additional properties and methods that are specific to their type.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using inheritance and polymorphism, we can create a hierarchy of classes that represents the relationships between different entities in the humane society, and we can write code that is more modular, flexible, and reusable."

        "## Object-Oriented Programmign at the Humane Society\n",
        "As we previously learned, in object-oriented programming (OOP), we use classes to define the properties and behavior of objects. A class is like a blueprint for creating objects, and it defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects of that class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, at the humane society we might have clases such as the follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   `Animal` - Represents all animals at the humane society. This class might have attributes such as name, breed, age, and medical history, and methods such as eat() and sleep().\n",
        "-   `Dog` - Represents dogs at the humane society. This class could inherit from the Animal class, and it might have additional attributes such as leash trained and good with kids, and methods such as bark() and playFetch().\n",
        "-   `Cat` - Represents cats at the humane society. This class could also inherit from the Animal class, and it might have additional attributes such as declawed and litter trained, and methods such as meow() and purr().\n",
        "-   `Person` - Represents people involved with the humane society, such as staff, volunteers, and adopters. This class might have attributes such as name, address, and phone number, and methods such as adoptAnimal() and volunteer().\n",
        "-   `Adoption` - Represents an adoption of an animal by a person. This class might have attributes such as adoption date and adoption fee, and methods such as processAdoption() and completeAdoption()."
