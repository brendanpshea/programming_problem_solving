        "### Brendan Shea, PhD\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to your next phase of Java programming! In this chapter, we'll explore advanced concepts using examples from the Star Wars universe - from managing movie theater seating to organizing character databases and calculating box office statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "You've built an impressive foundation of programming skills. Let's review what you've mastered:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Variables and Data Types**: You can store and manipulate different types of information - `int movieRating = 8`, `double ticketPrice = 12.50`, `String characterName = \"Luke\"`, and `boolean isJedi = true`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Control Structures**: You've mastered decision-making with if-else statements and repetition with loops. Your programs can now make choices and handle repetitive tasks efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Arrays**: You can organize collections of data like `String[] characters = {\"Luke\", \"Leia\", \"Han\"}` and process them systematically.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Functions**: Most importantly, you learned to break complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces. You can write reusable code that's organized, maintainable, and easy to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Ready for the Next Level\n",
        "\n",
        "Now you're ready to tackle more sophisticated programming challenges. The concepts in this chapter will significantly expand what you can accomplish:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔄 **Casting: Converting Between Data Types**\n",
        "Sometimes you need to convert data from one type to another - like converting `double boxOffice = 2.2` billion to `int boxOfficeMillions = (int) (boxOffice * 1000)`. You'll learn when Java converts automatically and when you need to explicitly cast types.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🌌 **Nulls: Handling Missing Data**\n",
        "In real programs, data isn't always available. Java's `null` represents \"no value\" - like when `String director = null` because that information isn't known yet. You'll learn to handle these situations gracefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🏗️ **Multi-dimensional Arrays: Organizing Complex Data**\n",
        "Move beyond simple lists to organize data in grids and more complex structures. Think theater seating charts: `String[][] seats = new String[10][20]` creates a 2D array for 10 rows of 20 seats each.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 📚 **Imports and Libraries: Using Pre-built Tools**\n",
        "Java provides powerful libraries of pre-written code. Instead of writing your own random number generator, you can `import java.util.Random` and use `Random rand = new Random()`. You'll discover the most useful built-in tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this chapter, you'll combine all these concepts to build a comprehensive Star Wars character and movie database system. You'll manage information across multiple dimensions, handle missing data gracefully, convert between different data formats, and leverage Java's built-in libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "These concepts might seem challenging at first, but each builds upon what you already know. Take time to understand each example and experiment with the code. Practice is key to mastering these advanced techniques.\n",

        "## The Force of Type Conversion\n",
        "\n",
        "In programming, **casting** is the process of converting data from one type to another. Just like how movie theaters need to convert digital ticket sales to printed receipts, or how box office earnings in billions need to be displayed as whole millions, your programs often need to transform data between different types.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Do We Need Casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider this scenario: You're calculating the average rating for Star Wars movies, but your data comes from different sources:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "int episode4Rating = 8;      // User rating out of 10\n",
        "double criticScore = 93.5;   // Critic score out of 100\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "To combine these meaningfully, you might need to convert the integer to a double, or the double to an integer. That's where casting comes in.\n",
        "\n",
        "Java handles type conversion in two ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Automatic (Implicit) Casting\n",
        "Java automatically converts smaller data types to larger ones when it's safe:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "int tickets = 150;\n",
        "double revenue = tickets * 12.50;  // int automatically becomes double\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This works because a double can hold any integer value without losing information.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Manual (Explicit) Casting\n",
        "When conversion might lose information, you must explicitly tell Java to do it:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "double boxOffice = 2.2;  // 2.2 billion dollars\n",
        "int millions = (int) boxOffice;  // Results in 2 (loses decimal part)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The `(int)` tells Java \"I know this might lose data, but do it anyway.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Basic Syntax\n",
        "\n",
        "Explicit casting uses parentheses with the target type:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "(targetType) value\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "- `(int) 3.7` converts to `3`\n",
        "- `(double) 5` converts to `5.0`\n",
        "- `(char) 65` converts to `'A'`\n",
        "\n",
        "## When Casting Happens\n",
        "\n",
        "You'll commonly use casting when:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Combining different numeric types**: Mixing integers and decimals in calculations\n",
        "2. **Working with user input**: Converting strings to numbers\n",
        "3. **Displaying data**: Converting precise calculations to rounded display values\n",
        "4. **Working with arrays**: When array indices need to be integers but your calculations produce decimals\n",
        "\n",
        "## A Quick Example\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a simple movie theater calculation that uses casting:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "double ticketPrice = 12.50;\n",
        "int soldTickets = 847;\n",
        "double grossRevenue = ticketPrice * soldTickets;  // Automatic casting\n",
        "int roundedRevenue = (int) grossRevenue;          // Explicit casting\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, `soldTickets` is automatically converted to a double for the multiplication, but we explicitly cast the result back to an integer for a rounded display value."

        "## Jedi Mind Tricks: Implicit vs Explicit Casting\n",
        "\n",
        "Java handles type conversion in two distinct ways, and knowing the difference is crucial for writing correct programs. Think of implicit casting as Java being helpful automatically, while explicit casting is you taking control when needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implicit Casting: Java's Automatic Help (Widening)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Implicit casting** happens automatically when Java can safely convert from a smaller data type to a larger one without losing information. This is also called **widening conversion** because you're moving to a \"wider\" container that can hold more data.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Java performs these conversions seamlessly in three main situations:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Mixed-type calculations:** When you combine different numeric types, Java automatically promotes the smaller type:\n",

        "int episodes = 9;\n",
        "double averageLength = 136.7;\n",
        "double totalMinutes = episodes * averageLength;  // int becomes double\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Variable assignments:** Assigning a smaller type to a larger variable happens automatically:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "int tickets = 250;\n",
        "double revenue = tickets;        // int automatically becomes double (250.0)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Method parameters:** When a method expects a larger type, Java converts smaller arguments automatically:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public static void printRating(double rating) { /* ... */ }\n",
        "\n",
        "int userRating = 8;\n",
        "printRating(userRating);  // int automatically becomes double\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Widening is Safe\n",

        "\n",
        "**Explicit casting** is required when converting from a larger type to a smaller one, or when there's potential for data loss. This is called **narrowing conversion** because you're moving to a \"narrower\" container.\n",

        "long worldwideBox = 5000000000L;  // 5 billion\n",
        "int overflow = (int) worldwideBox;  // OVERFLOW! Unpredictable result\n",
        "```\n",

        "\n",
        "Java automatically converts the integer to a double for the multiplication. If you need to display just the dollar amount without cents, you can cast back to remove the decimal portion.\n",

        "\n",
        "```java\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Unlike the numbers and characters we've been working with, `null` can only be assigned to reference types like `String`, arrays, and objects. You cannot assign `null` to primitive types like `int`, `double`, or `char`.\n",

        "### When Null Appears\n",
        "\n",
        "Null values appear in your programs in several common situations. When you declare a reference variable without initializing it, Java automatically sets it to `null`. This is different from primitives, which get default values like 0 or false.\n",

        "\n",
        "Null also enables optional data structures. Not every movie has a sequel, not every character has a middle name, and not every scene has dialogue. Null lets you represent these optional pieces of information naturally.\n",
        "\n",
        "For method return values, null provides a way to indicate failure or \"not found\" without throwing an exception. A search method can return the found item or null if nothing matches, letting the calling code decide how to handle the absence of results.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Working Safely with Null\n",
        "\n",
        "The key to working with null is developing defensive programming habits. Always assume that reference variables might be null unless you're certain they're not. Before calling methods or accessing properties, check if the value is null:\n",
        "\n",

        "## Avoiding the Null Trap: NullPointerException\n",
        "\n",
        "`NullPointerException` is probably the most frequent error you'll encounter in Java programming. Unlike compilation errors that prevent your program from running, this error strikes while your program is executing, often crashing it unexpectedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "The name itself tells the story: you're trying to use a \"pointer\" (reference) that points to nothing (null). It's like trying to open a door when there's no door there - the action itself doesn't make sense.\n",
        "\n",
        "This error occurs whenever you attempt to call a method or access a property on a reference that contains `null`:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "String title = null;\n",
        "int length = title.length();  // NullPointerException here!\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The program crashes at the exact moment it tries to execute `title.length()` because there's no actual String object to call the `length()` method on.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Common Scenarios That Cause NullPointerException\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding when these exceptions typically occur helps you prevent them before they happen. One frequent cause is forgetting to initialize variables, especially when working with arrays of objects:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "String[] movieTitles = new String[3];  // Array exists, but elements are null\n",
        "System.out.println(movieTitles[0].length());  // Crash! movieTitles[0] is null\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Another common scenario involves method return values. When methods return null to indicate \"not found\" or \"no data available,\" you must check the result before using it:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public static String getCharacterName(int id) {\n",
        "    if (id == 1) return \"Luke Skywalker\";\n",
        "    return null;  // Unknown character\n",
        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "// Dangerous usage:\n",
        "String name = getCharacterName(99);\n",
        "System.out.println(name.toUpperCase());  // Crash if id 99 returns null\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Chain operations are particularly dangerous because any link in the chain might be null:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "String result = getText().trim().toUpperCase();  // Any method could return null\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "If `getText()` returns null, the crash happens immediately. If `getText()` returns a valid string but `trim()` somehow returned null, the crash happens at `toUpperCase()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Reading NullPointerException Error Messages\n",
        "\n",
        "When your program crashes with a NullPointerException, Java provides helpful information about where the error occurred. The error message typically looks like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NullPointerException\n",
        "    at MovieAnalyzer.processTitle(MovieAnalyzer.java:15)\n",
        "    at MovieAnalyzer.main(MovieAnalyzer.java:8)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This tells you that the error happened in the `processTitle` method at line 15 of the `MovieAnalyzer.java` file. The stack trace shows the sequence of method calls that led to the error, helping you track down the source of the null value.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Prevention Strategies\n",
        "\n",
        "The best approach to handling null values is defensive programming - assume that any reference might be null unless you're absolutely certain it's not. Always validate your data before using it:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "// Safe approach - check before using\n",
        "String movieTitle = getMovieTitle();\n",

        "} else {\n",
        "    System.out.println(\"No title available\");\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "When working with arrays that might contain null elements, check each element individually:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "String[] cast = getCastMembers();\n",
        "for (int i = 0; i < cast.length; i++) {\n",
        "    if (cast[i] != null) {\n",
        "        System.out.println(\"Cast member: \" + cast[i]);\n",
        "    }\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "For method parameters, validate inputs at the beginning of your methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public static void printMovieInfo(String title, String director) {\n",
        "    if (title == null) {\n",
        "        System.out.println(\"Error: Movie title cannot be null\");\n",
        "        return;\n",
        "    }\n",
        "    if (director == null) {\n",
        "        director = \"Unknown Director\";  // Provide default\n",

        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The key principle is to never assume that reference variables contain valid objects. Always check for null before calling methods or accessing properties, and provide meaningful behavior when null values are encountered. This defensive approach prevents crashes and makes your programs more robust and user-friendly."

        "# Getting User Input with Scanner\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why Scanner Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "Up until now, your programs have worked with data you've written directly into your code. But real programs need to interact with users - getting their input, responding to their choices, and adapting based on what they enter. The `Scanner` class is Java's primary tool for reading user input from the keyboard.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of Scanner as a translator between the user's keyboard input and your Java program. When someone types \"Luke Skywalker\" and presses Enter, Scanner converts that text into a String your program can use. When they type \"25\" for their age, Scanner can convert that text into an integer for calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setting Up Scanner\n",
        "\n",
        "Before you can read any input, you need to set up Scanner properly. This involves importing the class and creating a Scanner object:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "import java.util.Scanner;\n",
        "\n",
        "public class InputExample {\n",
        "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
        "        // Create a Scanner object connected to keyboard input\n",
        "        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);\n",
        "        \n",
        "        // Your input code goes here...\n",
        "        \n",
        "        input.close();  // Good practice - close when done\n",
        "    }\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The `System.in` parameter tells Scanner to read from the keyboard (standard input). You typically create one Scanner object per program and use it throughout your main method.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Reading Different Types of Input\n",
        "\n",
        "Scanner provides specialized methods for reading different types of data. This is important because user input always starts as text, but you often need it converted to numbers or other data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reading Strings:** For text input, you have two main options:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "System.out.print(\"Enter your name: \");\n",
        "String name = input.nextLine();     // Reads entire line including spaces\n",
        "\n",
        "System.out.print(\"Enter one word: \");\n",
        "String word = input.next();         // Reads until space/enter\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Use `nextLine()` when you want to capture everything the user types, including spaces (like \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\"). Use `next()` when you only want a single word without spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reading Numbers:** Scanner automatically converts text input to numbers:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "System.out.print(\"Enter your age: \");\n",
        "int age = input.nextInt();\n",
        "\n",
        "System.out.print(\"Enter ticket price: \");\n",
        "double price = input.nextDouble();\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "These methods expect the user to enter valid numbers. If they type \"twenty\" instead of \"20\", your program will crash with an error.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Important Scanner Gotchas\n",
        "\n",
        "Scanner has one major quirk that trips up many programmers. When you use number-reading methods like `nextInt()`, they leave behind the \"Enter\" keypress in the input buffer. This can cause problems when you try to read strings afterward:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "System.out.print(\"Enter age: \");\n",
        "int age = input.nextInt();          // Reads number but leaves newline\n",
        "\n",
        "System.out.print(\"Enter name: \");\n",
        "String name = input.nextLine();     // Immediately reads the leftover newline!\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this code, the `nextLine()` call doesn't wait for user input - it immediately reads the leftover newline character from when they pressed Enter after typing their age.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Solution:** Add an extra `nextLine()` call to consume the leftover newline:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "System.out.print(\"Enter age: \");\n",
        "int age = input.nextInt();\n",
        "input.nextLine();                   // Consume the leftover newline\n",
        "\n",
        "System.out.print(\"Enter name: \");\n",
        "String name = input.nextLine();     // Now works correctly\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a common source of bugs, so remember this pattern whenever you mix number input with string input.\n",
