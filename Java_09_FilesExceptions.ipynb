        "At the *Bank of Evil*, nothing is more important than records. These are not just boring spreadsheets—they are the paper trail of world domination: deposits from stolen artwork, withdrawals for henchman payroll, and payments for custom shark tanks. If you can’t **store** this data somewhere permanent, you can’t run a proper evil empire.\n",

        "### **Files and Why We Use Them**\n",
        "\n",
        "A **file** is a place on your computer’s storage where data can live even after the program ends. You can think of it like the Bank of Evil’s vault: you can put things inside (writing) and take them out (reading).\n",
        "\n",
        "Two common file formats for simple data are:\n",

        "* **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)** – Each line represents one record, and values in that record are separated by commas.\n",
        "* **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** – Data is stored in a way that looks like Java objects, but as plain text.\n",
        "\n",
        "For now, we’ll start with **CSV** because it’s easier to work with as a beginner. A CSV file for villain bank transactions might look like this:\n",

        "\n",
        "At the Bank of Evil, the unexpected is part of daily life. Henchmen may forget to lock the vault. Sharks in the lair’s moat may refuse to eat the intruder. And sometimes, the “Deposit All Loot” button mysteriously wires funds to the *Bank of Goodness* instead. In programming, unexpected things happen too, and when they do, Java uses something called an **exception** to let us know.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What an exception is\n",
        "\n",
        "An **exception** is a special object that represents a problem in your program. When something goes wrong—like trying to open a file that doesn’t exist—Java *throws* an exception. Throwing an exception means the program stops its normal flow and looks for someone who can handle the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "If no one handles the exception, the program will crash. In the real world, that’s like a bank teller running away screaming instead of helping you fix a transaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Common examples\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are a few things that can cause exceptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Trying to read a file that isn’t there.\n",
        "* Dividing by zero.\n",
        "* Asking a program to convert `\"banana\"` into a number.\n",
        "* Accessing an array at an index that doesn’t exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Checked vs. unchecked exceptions\n",
        "\n",
        "In Java, there are two main kinds:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Checked exceptions** – Problems Java makes you deal with at compile time. For example, reading a file can throw a `FileNotFoundException`. You either have to handle it with a `try…catch` block or declare it with `throws`.\n",
        "* **Unchecked exceptions** – Problems that can happen while running your program (runtime errors) and that Java doesn’t force you to handle, like dividing by zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "For beginners, the main thing to remember is: **checked exceptions require handling**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Throwing and catching exceptions\n",
        "\n",
        "If something goes wrong, Java will “throw” an exception. If your code knows how to deal with it, you can “catch” it and respond, so the whole program doesn’t crash.\n",
        "\n",
        "We’ll see how to do that with `try…catch` in the next section. For now, here’s a very small example that will deliberately cause a `FileNotFoundException`:\n",

        "import java.io.FileNotFoundException;\n",

        "\n",
        "1. We create a `File` object pointing to a file that doesn’t exist.\n",
        "2. When `new Scanner(file)` tries to read it, Java throws a `FileNotFoundException`.\n",
        "3. Since we wrote `throws FileNotFoundException` in `main`, we told Java to pass the problem upward (to the program’s top level), which will crash and print an error message.\n",
        "\n",
        "That error message might look something like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Exception in thread \"main\" java.io.FileNotFoundException: nonexistent.csv (No such file or directory)\n",

        "* A “stack trace” showing where in the code it happened.\n",

        "### Why exceptions matter\n",
        "\n",
        "Ignoring exceptions is like ignoring alarms in the bank vault. You might get away with it once, but sooner or later, disaster strikes. Exceptions let your program notice problems and recover from them, or at least fail in a controlled way.\n",

        "\n",
        "At the Bank of Evil, it’s not enough to respond to problems—you want to **stop them before they happen**. If you know that some villains will try to enter “banana” as their account balance or withdraw more than they have, you can write code that blocks those actions early. This approach is called **defensive programming**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What defensive programming is\n",
        "\n",
        "Defensive programming is the practice of writing code that:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Anticipates mistakes or malicious behavior.\n",
        "* Validates data before using it.\n",
        "* Protects important resources from misuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it like the lair’s security system:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Don’t just have guards (exceptions).\n",
        "* Also have locked doors, keycards, and tripwires (preventative checks).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Input validation\n",
        "\n",
        "The most common defensive technique is **validating input**—checking that data is reasonable before using it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Preventing negative deposits or non-numeric amounts.\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public void deposit(double amount) {\n",
        "    if (amount <= 0) {\n",
        "        System.out.println(\"Error: Deposit amount must be positive.\");\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. We check `amount <= 0` before adding it to `balance`.\n",
        "2. If the data is bad, we print an error and stop.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Null checks\n",
        "\n",
        "Another source of trouble is using a variable that doesn’t point to any object (`null`). You can prevent this with **null checks**.\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "if (account != null) {\n",

        "\n",
        "### Assertions\n",
        "\n",
        "An **assertion** is a statement you put in code to check that something you believe is true really is true at that point in the program.\n",
        "You write them using the `assert` keyword:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "If assertions are enabled and the condition is false, the program will stop and print the message. Assertions are mainly for testing and debugging, not for handling user mistakes.\n",

        "### Encapsulation as defense\n",
        "\n",
        "From your last chapter on OOP: **encapsulation** (keeping fields private and controlling access through methods) is also a defensive technique.\n",
        "If you make `balance` private and only allow changes through methods like `deposit` and `withdraw`, you can enforce rules in those methods and prevent direct, unsafe changes.\n",

        "When you build a program, you’re designing a kind of structure. Sometimes it’s a small storage shed; sometimes it’s the *Bank of Evil’s* main headquarters with shark tanks, laser grids, and underground lairs. Whatever you build, it’s easier to construct, protect, and improve if it’s well designed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Good program design isn’t just about making things work—it’s about making them **work well** for a long time. The goal is to write code that is:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Clear enough for someone else (or you, six months later) to understand.\n",
        "* Flexible enough to change without breaking everything.\n",

        "### Modularity – Breaking the Bank into Rooms\n",
        "\n",
        "**Definition:** Modularity means dividing your program into small, self-contained parts (methods, classes, or packages) that each do one specific job.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why it matters:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Smaller parts are easier to understand and test.\n",

        "\n",
        "Analogy: In the Bank of Evil, the vault, the laser system, and the shark tank are separate systems. If the sharks go on strike, the vault still works.\n",

        "Example:\n",
        "\n",

        "public class SecureAccount {\n",
