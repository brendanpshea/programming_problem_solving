        "At the *Bank of Evil*, nothing is more important than records. These are not just boring spreadsheets—they are the paper trail of world domination: deposits from stolen artwork, withdrawals for henchman payroll, and payments for custom shark tanks. If you can’t **store** this data somewhere permanent, you can’t run a proper evil empire.\n",

        "### **Files and Why We Use Them**\n",
        "\n",
        "A **file** is a place on your computer’s storage where data can live even after the program ends. You can think of it like the Bank of Evil’s vault: you can put things inside (writing) and take them out (reading).\n",
        "\n",
        "Two common file formats for simple data are:\n",

        "## Expecting the Unexpected: What Are Exceptions?\n",
        "\n",
        "At the Bank of Evil, the unexpected is part of daily life. Henchmen may forget to lock the vault. Sharks in the lair’s moat may refuse to eat the intruder. And sometimes, the “Deposit All Loot” button mysteriously wires funds to the *Bank of Goodness* instead. In programming, unexpected things happen too, and when they do, Java uses something called an **exception** to let us know.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What an exception is\n",
        "\n",
        "An **exception** is a special object that represents a problem in your program. When something goes wrong—like trying to open a file that doesn’t exist—Java *throws* an exception. Throwing an exception means the program stops its normal flow and looks for someone who can handle the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "If no one handles the exception, the program will crash. In the real world, that’s like a bank teller running away screaming instead of helping you fix a transaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Common examples\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are a few things that can cause exceptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Trying to read a file that isn’t there.\n",
        "* Dividing by zero.\n",
        "* Asking a program to convert `\"banana\"` into a number.\n",
        "* Accessing an array at an index that doesn’t exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Checked vs. unchecked exceptions\n",
        "\n",
        "In Java, there are two main kinds:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Checked exceptions** – Problems Java makes you deal with at compile time. For example, reading a file can throw a `FileNotFoundException`. You either have to handle it with a `try…catch` block or declare it with `throws`.\n",
        "* **Unchecked exceptions** – Problems that can happen while running your program (runtime errors) and that Java doesn’t force you to handle, like dividing by zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "For beginners, the main thing to remember is: **checked exceptions require handling**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Throwing and catching exceptions\n",
        "\n",
        "If something goes wrong, Java will “throw” an exception. If your code knows how to deal with it, you can “catch” it and respond, so the whole program doesn’t crash.\n",
        "\n",
        "We’ll see how to do that with `try…catch` in the next section. For now, here’s a very small example that will deliberately cause a `FileNotFoundException`:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "import java.io.File;\n",
        "import java.io.FileNotFoundException;\n",
        "import java.util.Scanner;\n",
        "\n",
        "public class MissingFileExample {\n",
        "    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {\n",
        "        File file = new File(\"nonexistent.csv\");\n",
        "        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file); // This will throw an exception\n",
        "    }\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this code:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. We create a `File` object pointing to a file that doesn’t exist.\n",
        "2. When `new Scanner(file)` tries to read it, Java throws a `FileNotFoundException`.\n",
        "3. Since we wrote `throws FileNotFoundException` in `main`, we told Java to pass the problem upward (to the program’s top level), which will crash and print an error message.\n",
        "\n",
        "That error message might look something like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Exception in thread \"main\" java.io.FileNotFoundException: nonexistent.csv (No such file or directory)\n",
        "    at java.base/java.util.Scanner.<init>(Scanner.java:639)\n",
        "    ...\n",
        "```\n",

        "The message includes:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The type of exception (`FileNotFoundException`).\n",
        "* A description of what went wrong.\n",
        "* A “stack trace” showing where in the code it happened.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why exceptions matter\n",
        "\n",
        "Ignoring exceptions is like ignoring alarms in the bank vault. You might get away with it once, but sooner or later, disaster strikes. Exceptions let your program notice problems and recover from them, or at least fail in a controlled way.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the next section, we’ll see how to actually **catch** exceptions with `try…catch` so that the Bank of Evil’s systems can keep running even when something goes wrong.\n"
