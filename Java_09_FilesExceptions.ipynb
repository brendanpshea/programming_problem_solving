        "# Introduction - Welcome to the Bank of Evil\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you're writing software for the Bank of Evil, where cartoon villains keep their stolen money. Gru needs to withdraw funds for his moon heist. Vector wants a loan for piranha guns. Your banking system needs to handle all of this... but what happens when things go wrong?\n",
        "\n",
        "Right now, when your programs hit an error, they crash with a scary error message. That's not acceptable for real software. This chapter teaches you how to write programs that expect problems and handle them gracefully. This is called **defensive programming**.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Your First Taste of Trouble\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's see what happens when a program encounters a problem:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public class EvilBankDemo {\n",
        "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
        "        String[] villains = {\"Gru\", \"Vector\", \"Scarlet\"};\n",
        "        System.out.println(\"Villain #4: \" + villains[3]);\n",
        "    }\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This crashes! Java shows an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` because we tried to access position 3, but the array only has positions 0, 1, and 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "When Java encounters a problem it can't handle, it creates an **exception** - Java's way of saying \"Something went wrong!\" Right now, exceptions crash your program. By the end of this chapter, you'll know how to catch and handle them properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What You'll Build\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll create a simple Bank of Evil system that:\n",
        "- Stores villain account balances in files\n",
        "- Handles deposits and withdrawals\n",
        "- Deals with problems like insufficient funds without crashing\n",
        "- Uses inheritance to create different account types (building on last chapter's OOP concepts)\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a preview of where we're heading:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This code tries to withdraw money. If there aren't enough funds, it catches the problem and prints a helpful message instead of crashing. The program keeps running, ready for the next villain.\n",

        "# Saving Villain Data - Your First Files\n",
        "\n",
        "The Bank of Evil needs to remember account balances even after the program ends. When Gru deposits money today, it should still be there tomorrow. That's where files come in. Java programs can save data to files and read it back later.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Writing to a File\n",
        "\n",
        "To write to files in Java, we use a class called `PrintWriter`. This class works almost exactly like `System.out.println()`, but instead of printing to the screen, it prints to a file.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, you need to import the necessary classes at the top of your program:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "import java.io.PrintWriter;\n",
        "import java.io.FileNotFoundException;\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The first import gives us `PrintWriter`. The second import is for something called `FileNotFoundException` - an exception that Java requires us to handle when working with files. For now, we'll add `throws FileNotFoundException` after our method name to tell Java \"we know this might go wrong\":\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {\n",
        "    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"villains.txt\");\n",
        "    writer.println(\"Gru\");\n",
        "    writer.close();\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This creates a file named \"villains.txt\" and writes \"Gru\" to it. The `close()` method is crucial - it saves your data and releases the file so other programs can use it. Think of it like saving a document before closing it.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Adding More Data\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you have a `PrintWriter`, you can write as many lines as you want:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"villains.txt\");\n",
        "writer.println(\"Gru\");\n",
        "writer.println(\"Vector\");\n",
        "writer.println(\"Scarlet\");\n",
        "writer.close();\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Each `println()` adds a new line to the file. When you run this program, it creates a text file with three villain names, each on its own line.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Reading from a File\n",
        "\n",
        "Reading files uses `Scanner`, the same class you've used for keyboard input. But instead of reading from `System.in`, we tell it to read from a file.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, import what we need:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "import java.util.Scanner;\n",
        "import java.io.File;\n",
        "import java.io.FileNotFoundException;\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The `File` class represents a file on your computer. We create a `File` object, then pass it to `Scanner`:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {\n",
        "    File inputFile = new File(\"villains.txt\");\n",
        "    Scanner reader = new Scanner(inputFile);\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Now `reader` reads from the file instead of the keyboard. To read one line:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "String villain = reader.nextLine();\n",
        "System.out.println(\"Found: \" + villain);\n",
        "reader.close();\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Reading All Lines\n",
        "\n",
        "Files can have many lines, and we often don't know how many. The `hasNextLine()` method checks if there's more to read:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "File inputFile = new File(\"villains.txt\");\n",
        "Scanner reader = new Scanner(inputFile);\n",
        "\n",
        "while (reader.hasNextLine()) {\n",
        "    String villain = reader.nextLine();\n",
        "    System.out.println(\"Found villain: \" + villain);\n",
        "}\n",
        "reader.close();\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The loop continues until it reaches the end of the file. This pattern - checking `hasNextLine()` before calling `nextLine()` - prevents errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "## CSV Format for Multiple Values\n",
        "\n",
        "The Bank of Evil needs to store more than just names. We need account numbers and balances too. CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is perfect for this. It's just a text file where each line contains values separated by commas.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's what CSV data looks like:\n",
        "```\n",
        "1001,Gru,50000.00\n",
        "1002,Vector,75000.00\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Each line has three pieces of information: account number, name, and balance. To write CSV data:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(\"accounts.csv\");\n",
        "writer.println(\"1001,Gru,50000.00\");\n",
        "writer.println(\"1002,Vector,75000.00\");\n",
        "writer.close();\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Reading CSV Data\n",
        "\n",
        "To read CSV data, we read a line and then split it into parts. Java's `split()` method breaks a string at every comma:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "String line = \"1001,Gru,50000.00\";\n",
        "String[] parts = line.split(\",\");\n",
        "// Now: parts[0] is \"1001\"\n",
        "//      parts[1] is \"Gru\"  \n",
        "//      parts[2] is \"50000.00\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The `split(\",\")` method returns an array of strings. We can then access each piece by its index.\n",
        "\n",

        "# Try and Catch - Catching Problems\n",
        "\n",
        "Right now, exceptions crash your program. But Java gives you a way to catch exceptions and handle them gracefully. This is done with a `try-catch` block. Think of it as putting a safety net under dangerous code.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Your First Try-Catch\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic structure looks like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "try {\n",
        "    // Dangerous code goes here\n",
        "} catch (Exception e) {\n",
        "    // What to do if something goes wrong\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The `try` block contains code that might throw an exception. If an exception occurs, Java immediately jumps to the `catch` block. Let's fix our array problem from before:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "String[] villains = {\"Gru\", \"Vector\", \"Scarlet\"};\n",
        "\n",
        "try {\n",
        "    System.out.println(villains[10]);\n",
        "} catch (Exception e) {\n",
        "    System.out.println(\"That villain doesn't exist!\");\n",
        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "System.out.println(\"Program continues running!\");\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Now instead of crashing, the program prints \"That villain doesn't exist!\" and continues. The last line executes normally.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How Try-Catch Works\n",
        "\n",
        "When Java executes a try-catch:\n",
        "1. It starts running the code in the `try` block\n",
        "2. If no exception occurs, it skips the `catch` block entirely\n",
        "3. If an exception occurs, it immediately jumps to the `catch` block\n",
        "4. After the catch block (or try block if no exception), the program continues\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example that shows this flow:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "System.out.println(\"1. Before try\");\n",
        "\n",
        "try {\n",
        "    System.out.println(\"2. Inside try - before problem\");\n",
        "    int result = 10 / 0;  // Exception happens here!\n",
        "    System.out.println(\"3. This NEVER prints\");\n",
        "} catch (Exception e) {\n",
        "    System.out.println(\"4. Caught a problem!\");\n",
        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "System.out.println(\"5. After try-catch\");\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This prints: 1, 2, 4, 5. Notice that step 3 never executes - when the exception occurs, Java immediately jumps to the catch block.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Exception Variable\n",
        "\n",
        "The catch block receives an exception object (we usually call it `e`). This object contains information about what went wrong:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "try {\n",
        "    int[] scores = {10, 20};\n",
        "    System.out.println(scores[5]);\n",
        "} catch (Exception e) {\n",
        "    System.out.println(\"Error: \" + e.getMessage());\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The `getMessage()` method returns a description of the problem. For an array index error, it might return \"Index 5 out of bounds for length 2\".\n",
        "\n",
        "## Catching File Exceptions\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember how we've been using `throws FileNotFoundException`? Now we can handle it properly:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "try {\n",
        "    File file = new File(\"missing.txt\");\n",
        "    Scanner reader = new Scanner(file);\n",
        "    System.out.println(reader.nextLine());\n",
        "    reader.close();\n",
        "} catch (Exception e) {\n",
        "    System.out.println(\"Couldn't read file: \" + e.getMessage());\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "If the file doesn't exist, instead of crashing, the program displays a helpful message.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Catching Specific Exceptions\n",
        "\n",
        "You can catch specific types of exceptions. This lets you handle different problems differently:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "try {\n",
        "    // Some dangerous code\n",
        "} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n",
        "    System.out.println(\"File not found!\");\n",
        "} catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {\n",
        "    System.out.println(\"Invalid account number!\");\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Java checks each catch block in order. If the exception matches, that catch block runs. You can also have a general catch-all at the end:\n",
        "\n",
        "```java\n",
        "try {\n",
        "    // Dangerous code\n",
        "} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n",
        "    System.out.println(\"File not found!\");\n",
        "} catch (Exception e) {\n",
        "    System.out.println(\"Something else went wrong: \" + e.getMessage());\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## When to Use Try-Catch\n",
        "\n",
        "Use try-catch when:\n",
        "- Working with files (they might not exist)\n",
        "- Converting strings to numbers (user might type \"abc\" instead of \"123\")\n",
        "- Accessing arrays with user-provided indices\n",
        "- Any time your program interacts with the outside world\n",
        "\n",
        "Don't wrap your entire program in one giant try-catch. Instead, catch exceptions close to where they might occur and handle them appropriately.\n",

        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The `extends Exception` part makes your class an exception. Java now recognizes it as something that can be thrown and caught.\n",

        "## Adding a Message\n",

        "Exceptions become more helpful when they include messages. Add a constructor that accepts a message:\n",

        "```java\n",
        "public class InsufficientEvilFundsException extends Exception {\n",
        "    public InsufficientEvilFundsException(String message) {\n",

        "```java\n",

        "## Creating Multiple Custom Exceptions\n",
        "\n",
        "The Bank of Evil needs several custom exceptions. Here's another one:\n",

        "    }\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",

        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why Custom Exceptions Matter\n",
        "\n",
        "Custom exceptions make your code more professional and easier to debug. Instead of a generic \"Exception\", other programmers (and future you) know exactly what went wrong. \"InsufficientEvilFundsException\" is much clearer than \"Exception\"!\n",
